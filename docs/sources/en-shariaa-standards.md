Foreword by AAOIFI Secretary General
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and Allahs blessings and peace
be  upon  the  noblest  of  Messengers,  Prophet  Muhammad,  and  upon  his
household and the companions, and those who follow their example with
good conduct until the Day of Judgment.
It is of Allahs Grace that He bestowed on us the great religion of Islam,
and made us the best Ummah raised up for mankind, one that is graced
with  the  noblest  of  Prophets  and  Heavenly  Books  and  religious  codes.
This comprehensive religious code encompassed and ordained all things
beneficial to humankind in this life and in the Hereafter, and prohibited
and banned all evils and vices, as made clear in the Noble Qur`an:
(...Today, I have perfected your religion for you, and completed My
favour upon you, and have granted Islam as a religion for you...).(1)(1)
favour upon you, and have granted Islam as a religion for you...).
One of the basic pillars of Islamic Faith is the belief in, and perseverance
towards, the preservation of the well-being of people, and solid establishment
of markets, trade, finances, and to distance all of which from prohibitions
sanctioned in the Qur`an and the Sunnah; namely, Riba, Gharar, gambling,
illegal appropriation of peoples wealth, etc. This is also embodied in the
keenness to observe prohibitions in the area of financial transactions and
contracts, especially when it comes to honoring obligations, honesty and
straightforwardness, mutual consent of contracting parties, and so on.
Based on this set of norms and values, the Islamic finance industry was
established  and  has  attained  its  current  paramount  status,  as  manifested
in its growth at a pace greater than that of all other financial sectors. By so
doing, it will hopefully be a boon for all peoples and nations of the world.
The cornerstone of the Islamic finance industry is, and will always be,
the adherence to, and compliance with, the rules and principles of Shariah, ,
the adherence to, and compliance with, the rules and principles of Shariah

Foreword by AAOIFI Secretary General
under the broader collective reasoning by prominent Shariah scholars and
jurists, and based on evidences found in the Qur`an and the Sunnah, in
an attempt to deduce Shariah rulings that fit current-day reality and prac-
tices.
In this regard, the volume of Shariah Standards has become the major
compilation of contemporary Fiqh reasoning in the area of
Muamalat
Fiqh al-Muamalat
compilation of contemporary Fiqh reasoning in the area of Fiqh al-
(Jurisprudence of Financial Transactions) around the globe. The standards
cover a large array of Islamic financial contracts and products, including
those pertaining to banking, Islamic insurance, investment banking, capital
markets, financing, and so on.
These standards have acclaimed wide popularity within the global Islamic
finance  industry,  and  are  deemed  the  most  outstanding  Shariah  reference
for  this  industry  and  its  various  stakeholders,  including  legislative  bodies,
regulatory  authorities,  and  financial  institutions,  and  other  professional
entities such as law firms, accounting and consultancy firms, in addition to
universities,  academic  institutions  and  research  centers  and  Fatwa  issuing
bodies.
Currently, AAOIFI Standards are officially adopted by a number of central
banks and financial authorities on a mandatory basis or as guidance. Hence,
these standards are viewed as a major hallmark for the Islamic finance industry
and one of its principal accomplishments.
These standards would have not achieved such a prominence and outreach,
with  Allahs  Grace  and  Guidance  first  and  utmost,  had  there  been  no  great
efforts exerted by the Shariah scholars and Fuqaha and a host of experts and
professionals, volunteering a great deal of their time towards this great cause.
The success of these standards can be attributed to a set of factors, primarily
the  thorough  scholarly  methodology  (the  due  process)  that  AAOIFI
follows in its efforts to develop and issue the standards. The development
process is carried out through more than ten stages, commencing with the
commissioning of consultants to prepare the exposure drafts. The exposure
draft  is  then  submitted  to  the  respective  Shariah  Standards  Committee
which discusses and reviews it, and then forwards it to the Shariah Board to

public hearing
One of the major strengths of these standards is reflected in the collective
efforts made by the Shariah Board which consists of 20 prominent Shariah
scholars from around the world. This ensures globality and wide geographical
outreach of these standards in addition to accounting for various localities,
jurisdictions, applications and customary practices, etc. The standards also
embody  the  scholarly  background  diversification  among  board  members,
as  all  major  schools  of  Islamic  Law  are  duly  represented,  and  various
specializations are taken into consideration in its formation (from judiciary
to Fatwa issuing, consultancy, research, authorship, law, and economic and
financial advisory, etc.).
These  standards  also  pay  special  attention  to  noting  down  classical
Fiqh compendiums across ages, in the area of financial transactions, select-
ing the most practical and convenient out of these references, and giving
preponderance to specific rulings in the form of a classified and typified
standard. Furthermore, the standards account for modern applications of
Islamic financial contracts and products and relevant emerging matters.
They  also  grant  special  consideration  to  the  use  of  unified  terminology
and  disambiguation  of  its  different  components  and  aspects:  technical,
legal, accounting, financial, etc. Moreover, the standards involve the pro-
cess of deriving Shariah rulings to address all pertaining matters and to
provide guidance to the process of differentiation between impermissible
and  permissible  transactions  and  practices  all  in  one  neat,  summarized
compilation.
The Shariah Board has made incumbent upon itself, in view of the fast
pace of development and change in the Islamic finance industry, to review
7
Foreword by AAOIFI Secretary General
existing standards. It formed from amongst its members a special committee
for that purpose. The committee reviews all remarks and comments raised
by  scholars  and  experts  on  the  form  and  substance  of  the  standards.  The
reviews, in a bid to address the industrys requirements as to emerging matters,
have resulted in three classes of standards: (I) Standards whose items and
paragraphs were updated to remove ambiguity and clarify their meanings
and the rulings embedded therein, or to present more precise presentation
of content and so on. (II) Standards to which new paragraphs were added or
existing paragraphs were merged or omitted, so that the general structure of
the standard is maintained. (III) Standards which the board deemed in need
of a new preparation and development, in order to account for the sizable
emerging matters and changes relating to the topic of the standard such as
the Shariah Standards on Sukuk, Debit Card, Charge Card and Credit Card,
and so on. The development process for such standards has commenced and
is under way.
The new version of AAOIFI Shariah Standards has included a number
of reviewed and revised standards (of types 1 and 2, as mentioned above).
These standards are labeled with a Revised Standard designation.
We  are  ever  thankful  to  Allah  that  issuance  of  the  new  version  in  its
elegant layout has been completed both in hardcopy and digital formats.
A total of 15 new Shariah standards have been translated and added to the
English volume. As such, all Shariah standards, included in this edition,
have been issued both in Arabic and English. New standards are also under
preparation and are currently at different stages of the due process.
The  newly  translated  standards  that  have  been  added  to  this  edition
went through three extensive stages in implementation of proper quality
control
measures. The first stage constituted institutional efforts made by the
control measures. The first stage constituted institutional efforts made by the
International Shariah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA) and
the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). The second stage involved revision
by a legal expert (lawyer) who examined the translation from the angle of
accuracy and faithfulness to the original text and legal vocabulary. Finally,
in the third stage, the Translation Committee, consisting of the Honorable
Chairman of the Shariah Board and four esteemed members, edited and

fine-tuned the translation through ten meetings, some of which spanned
3 successive days. To all of them, we extend our sincere appreciation and
best wishes. I would also like to thank my colleague Mr. Mohammad Majd
Bakir  (Corporate  Development  Manager,  AAOIFI)  for  his  outstanding
efforts to accomplish this project.
We warmly welcome your remarks and feedback, including errata, on
existing standards and your proposals as to new standards, on our email:

Foreword by Shariah Boards Chairman
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and peace be upon our master
Muhammad, the last-sent Prophet and the leader of Prophets, and on all
his household and the companions, and those who follow their example in
good conduct till the Day of Judgment.
As to what follows,
Islamic banking does considerably differ from its conventional counterpart
in terms of principles, norms, values, and practices. The
specialty of Islamic
in terms of principles, norms, values, and practices. The specialty of Islamic
banking and the soundness of its transactions must be clearly reflected in
accounting  treatments  so  that  no  confusion  arises,  and  no  mistakes  are
committed in practice. Conventional accounting cannot serve the purpose,
as it is based on a different set of norms and values. Therefore, it was vital
that Islamic banks and financial institutions (IFIs) have their own accounting
standards, rather than conventional ones. The development of the standards
was  and  is  still  a  gigantic  task  that  draws  on  the  great  efforts  exerted  by
Shariah scholars and professional experts alike. Since inception in 1411 A.H.
(corresponding to 1991 A.D.), AAOIFI has been exerting a lot of efforts in
the preparation of accounting standards for Islamic financial institutions and
auspiciously the standards have been well received by the industry, especially
in the area of Islamic banking where Islamic banks follow them on a mandatory
basis or as guidance, based on regulatory enforcement by central banks in
many  countries  around  the  globe.  Subsequently,  AAOIFI  decided  to  issue
Shariah standards in the same way it had issued its accounting standards, in
order to provide a reference for Islamic banks and financial institutions to
comply with Shariah in their transactions and products and to harmonize
various  Fatwas  issued  by  different  Shariah  Supervisory  Boards  (SSBs).  To
that end, AAOIFI formed its Shariah Board in 1419 A.H. (corresponding to
Fiqh al-Muaamalat
1999 A.D.) consisting of Shariah scholars versed with Fiqh al-Muaamalat
1999 A.D.) consisting of Shariah scholars versed with

of  Islamic  banking.  The  Board,  with  Allahs  Grace,  has  managed  to  issue
more  than  54  standards  hitherto,  covering  a  wide  array  of  Shariah  rules
pertaining to financial transactions of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs).
pertaining  to  financial  transactions  of  Islamic  financial  institutions  (IFIs).
These  standards  have  become  a  reliable  reference  for  the  Islamic  banking
industry, and an essential part of academic curricula in universities, colleges
and schools offering education on Islamic banking.
The Board exerts due diligence to develop these standards through the
due  process  which  initiatives  with  commissioning  of  a  consultant/scholar
knowledgeable in the area relevant to the topic of the standard. An additional
study will be conducted to take into consideration all relevant issues in light
of the Noble Qur`an, the Sunnah, and major schools of Islamic Law, setting
out  Shariah  basis  and  newly  emerging  matters  along  with  contemporary
Fiqh views. Then, an exposure draft is prepared for the prospective standard.
The study and exposure draft will be submitted to a committee formed from
amongst the Board members in addition to a number of external, specialized
scholars. For that purpose, the Board formed four committees that convene
to review the exposure draft and prepare it for submission to the Shariah
Board. The Board used to convene every week and other week in Makkah
Al-Mukarramah  and  Al-Madinah  Al-Munawwarah,  in  turns.  It  currently
convenes only four times a year at least, two in the Two Holy Cities, and two
elsewhere.
Afterward, the exposure drafts reviewed by the committees are discussed

line in line out in the Boards meetings in a deliberate and unhindered
until  a  standard  is  adopted  based  on  consensus  or  the  opinion  of  the
majority. Thereafter, AAOIFI holds a public hearing to present and discuss
the proposed standard with a host of scholars and practitioners who voice
their  views  and  opinions,  whether  in  the  form  of  deletions,  additions,  or
amendment. The feedback will be presented to the Board again in its next
meeting for discussion. This will represent an opportunity for the Board to
discuss the standard for the last time before issuance, where it can add or
delete or amend it as deemed appropriate after extensive discussions. At this
stage, the due process completes and the standard is officially adopted and
issued.

Foreword by Shariah Boards Chairman
In this regard, two important facts are worth noting:
First, these standards are issued by the Board, not by an individual or
an ad-hoc group of individuals. Hence, the rulings and provisions reached
at  in  the  standards  shall  not  be  attributed  to  a  specific  member  in  his
personal  capacity.  The  Board  follows  a  professional  methodology  as  do
most similar international bodies. Its decisions are taken by the majority
of  members,  while  those  members  with  opposing  views  or  reservations
will be referred to along with their views or reservations in the minutes of
meetings. The decisions will be issued under the name of the Board and
points of incongruity will not be mentioned. Most of the provisions in the
standards issued by the Board are typically agreed on by all members. It
is not unusual, however, that different points of view often emerge as to
Ijtihad), especially in relation
rulings developed on the basis of reasoning (

thereto in the body of the standard.

Second, despite the above-mentioned steps followed by the Board in its
keenness  to  take  prudent  measures  in  the  process  of  standards  issuance,
this all remains a human endeavor that is fallible by nature, where mistakes
and oversight are not completely ruled out, and infallibility only belongs to
Prophets and Messengers (peace be upon them). Therefore, the Board formed
a review committee to look into its existing standards. Should a mistake or
oversight be pinpointed, or should there be any suggestion for improvement
of  the  standards,  we  would  be  thankful  to  receive  feedback  from  scholars
(please  address  them  to  AAOIFIs  General  Secretariat,  which  will  submit
them in turn to the Board through the review committee, Allahs Willing).
Lastly, I would like to extend my appreciation to all Board members for
their invaluable efforts and contributions to the realization of this splendid
achievement,  purely  dedicated  to  Allah,  and  also  for  the  spirit  of  under-
standing they exhibited during constructive scholarly deliberations. I would
also  like  to  thank  AAOIFI  for  its  remarkable  initiative  embodied  in  this

outstanding accomplishment and for its unwavering efforts to support and
facilitate the errand of the Board as it saved no means to arrange the Boards
meetings, to iron out all obstacles and difficulties, and to follow up on the
Boards resolutions and communicate them to all parties concerned. I do
supplicate to Allah to amply reward all those who sincerely contributed to-
wards this work, and I pray that Allah accept it and extend its benefits to
people everywhere.
And praise be to Allah, first and foremost,
Muhammad Taqi Usmani

Introduction
The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Insti-
Insti-
The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial
tutions (AAOIFI), formerly known as Financial Accounting Organization
for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions, was established in accordance
with the Agreement of Association which was signed by Islamic financial
institutions on 1 Safar 1410 A.H., corresponding to 26 February 1990 A.D.,
in Algiers. AAOIFI was registered on 11 Ramadan 1411 A.H., corresponding
to 27 March 1991 A.D., in the Kingdom of Bahrain as an international auton-
omous non-profit making corporate body.
Objectives of AAOIFI are:
1.  To develop accounting and auditing thoughts relevant to Islamic
financial institutions;
2.  To  disseminate  accounting  and  auditing  thoughts  relevant  to  Islamic
financial institutions and their applications through training, seminars,
publication of periodical newsletters, carrying out and commissioning
of research and other means;
3.  To prepare, promulgate and interpret accounting and auditing standards
for Islamic financial institutions; and
4.  To review and amend accounting and auditing standards for Islamic
financial institutions.
AAOIFI  carries  out  these  objectives  in  accordance  with  the  precepts  of
Islamic Shariah which represents a comprehensive system for all aspects of
life, in conformity with the environment in which Islamic financial institutions
have  developed.  This  activity  is  intended  both  to  enhance  the  confidence
of  users  of  the  financial  statements  of  Islamic  financial  institutions  in  the
information that is produced about these institutions, and to encourage these
users to invest or deposit their funds in Islamic financial institutions and to
use their services.
Before the establishment of AAOIFI, intensive efforts were made on both
administrative and technical levels beginning with the working paper that
2121
Introduction
was presented by the Islamic Development Bank during the annual meeting
of its board of governors in Istanbul in March 1987. Thereafter, a number of
committees were formed to examine the appropriate methods of preparing
accounting standards for Islamic financial institutions. These committees
produced several research studies and reports.(1)(1)
produced several research studies and reports.
Since  its  establishment  in  1411  A.H.,  corresponding  to  1991  A.D.  and
until 1415 A.H., corresponding to 1995 A.D., the organizational structure of
AAOIFI comprised the Supervisory Committee which consisted of seventeen
members,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  which  consisted  of
twenty  one  members,  an  Executive  Committee  appointed  from  within  the
members of the Standards Board, and a Shariah Committee of four members.
After four years of work, the Supervisory Committee decided to form
a review committee to look into the statute of AAOIFI and its organizational
structure. The amendments that were later introduced in the statute, which
were approved by the Supervisory Committee, included the renaming of
the  Organization  and  the  changing  of  its  organizational  structure.  The
revised  structure  consisted  of  a  General  Assembly,  a  Board  of  Trustees
(which replaced the supervisory committee), an Accounting and Auditing
Standards Board (which replaced the former board that was confined to
accounting  standards  only),  an  Executive  Committee,  a  Shariah  Board
and a General Secretariat to be headed by a Secretary-General.
The  amendment  of  the  statute  also  included  changing  the  method  of
financing  AAOIFI.  In  the  past,  AAOIFI  was  financed  by  contributions
paid by the founding members (Islamic Development Bank, Dar Al-Maal
Al-Islami  Group,  Al  Rajhi  Banking  &  Investment  Corporation,  Dallah
Al  Baraka  and  Kuwait  Finance  House).  The  revised  statute  calls  for  the
establishment of a Waqf (endowment) and charity fund to be financed from
membership fee that is paid only once by institutions joining AAOIFI. The
proceeds from this fund, the annual subscription fees, grants, donations,
bequests and others are the sources from which AAOIFI funds its activities.

 These studies and reports are compiled in five volumes and were lodged in the library
of  the  Islamic  Research  and  Training  Institute  of  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  in
Jeddah - Saudi Arabia under serial no. (332/121021).

other things, the broadening of AAOIFIs objectives. Article (4) of the
amended statute states that AAOIFI shall:
1.  Develop  the  accounting,  auditing  and  banking  practices  thought
relating to the activities of Islamic financial institutions.
2.  Disseminate  the  accounting  and  auditing  thought  relating  to  the
activities  of  Islamic  financial  institutions  and  their  applications
through  training,  seminars,  publication  of  periodical  newsletters,
preparation of research and other means.
3.  Prepare, promulgate and interpret accounting and auditing standards
for Islamic financial institutions in order to harmonize the accounting

financial statements, as well as to harmonize the auditing procedures
adopted  in  auditing  the  financial  statements  prepared  by  Islamic
financial institutions.
4.  Review and amend the accounting and auditing standards for Islamic

institutions that are published by AAOIFI.

and principles in all their transactions.

The conditions of membership specified in Article (8) of the amended
statute stipulate that every member should pay the prescribed membership

Shariah Standard No. (1): Trading in Currencies
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  issues  of  both  actual  and  constructive  possession
of currencies, the use of modern means of communication in currency
trading, exchange of currencies in the context of the bilateral settlement of
debts owed by the parties to the exchange, dealing in currencies in money
markets, bilateral promises to buy and sell currencies, deferment of the
delivery of one of two countervalues in currency trading, and some cases
practised by the Institutions.
  The standard does not cover the following cases: those where there are
no trading in currencies; the effect of goldsmithery in selling gold and
silver; transfers of debts that do not involve exchanges of currency; and
the discounting of bills of exchange.
2. Shariah Ruling on Trading in Currencies
2/1  It is permissible to trade in currencies, provided that it is done in
compliance with the following Shariah rules and precepts:
2/1/1 Both parties must take possession of the countervalues before
dispersing, such possession being either actual or constructive.
2/1/2 The  countervalues  of  the  same  currency  must  be  of  equal
amount, even if one of them is in paper money and the other
is in coin of the same country, like a note of one pound for
a coin of one pound.
2/1/3  The contract shall not contain any conditional option or defer-
ment clause regarding the delivery of one or both countervalues.
2/1/4 The dealing in currencies shall not aim at establishing a mo-
nopoly position, nor should it entail any evil consequences to
the interest of individuals or societies.
5252
Shariah Standard No. (1): Trading in Currencies
2/1/5 Currency transactions shall not be carried out on the forward
or futures market.
2/2  It is prohibited to enter into forward currency contracts. This rule
applies
whether  such  contracts  are  effected  through  the  exchange  of
applies  whether  such  contracts  are  effected  through  the  exchange  of
deferred transfers of debt or through the execution of a deferred contract
in  which  the  concurrent  possession  of  both  of  the  countervalues  by
both parties does not take place.
2/3  It is also prohibited to deal in the forward currency market even if the
purpose is hedging to avoid a loss of profit on a particular transaction
effected in a currency whose value is expected to decline.
2/4  It is permissible for the Institution to hedge against the future de-
valuation of the currency by recourse to the following:
2/4/1 To execute back to back interest free loans using different cur-
rencies without receiving or giving any extra benefit, provided
these two loans are not contractually connected to each other.
2/4/2 Where the exposure is in respect of an account payable, to
sell goods on credit or by Murabahah in the currency of the
exposure.
2/5  It is permissible for the Institution and the customer to agree, at the
time of settlement of the instalments of a credit transaction (such as
a Murabahah), that the payment shall be made in another currency
applying the spot exchange rate on the day of payment.
2/6  Possession in sales of currencies
2/6/1 When a contract is concluded for the sale of an amount of
currency,  possession  must  be  taken  for  the  whole  amount
that is the subject matter of the contract at the closing of the
transaction.
2/6/2 Taking  possession  of  one  of  the  countervalues  by  one  party
without taking possession of the other is not enough to
without taking possession of the other is not enough to make make
a  currency  dealing  transaction  permissible.  Likewise,  taking
partial possession is not sufficient. Taking possession of part
5353
Shariah Standard No. (1): Trading in Currencies
of a countervalue is valid only in respect of the part, posses-
of which is complete, whereas the remaining part of the
sion of which is complete, whereas the remaining part of the
sion
transaction remains invalid.
2/6/3 Possession may take place either physically or constructively.
The  form  of  taking  possession  of  assets  differs  according  to
their nature and customary business practices.
2/6/4 Physical  possession  takes  place  by  means  of  simultaneous
delivery by hand.
2/6/5 Constructive possession of an asset is deemed to have taken
place by the seller enabling the other party to take its delivery
and dispose of it, even if there is no physical taking of posses-
sion. Among other forms of constructive possession that are
approved by both Shariah and business customary practices
are the following:
a) To credit a sum of money to the account of the customer in
the following situations:
1. When the Institution deposits to the credit of a customers
account a sum of money directly or through a bank transfer.
2. When the customer enters into a spot contract of currency
exchange between himself and the Institution, in the case
of  the  purchase  of  a  currency  against  another  currency
already deposited in the account of the customer.
3. When the Institution debits  by the order of the customer
  a  sum  of  money  to  the  latters  account  and  credits  it  to
another account in a different currency, either in the same
Institution  or  another  Institution,  for  the  benefit  of  the
customer or any other payee. In following such a procedure,
the Institution shall adhere to the principles of Islamic law
regarding currency exchange.
A  delay  in  making  the  transfer  is  allowed  to  the  Institution,
consistent with the practice whereby a payee may obtain actual
in currency
receipt according to prevailing business practices in currency

markets. However, the payee is not entitled to dispose of the
currency during the transfer period, unless and until the effect
of the bank transfer has taken effect so that the payee is able to
make an actual delivery of the currency to a third party.
b) Receipt of a cheque constitutes constructive possession, provid-
ed the balance payable is available in the account of the issuer in
the currency of the cheque and the Institution has blocked such
a balance for payment.
c) The receipt of a voucher by a merchant, signed by the credit
card holder (buyer), is constructive possession of the amount
that the
of currency entered as payable on the coupon provided that the
of currency entered as payable on the coupon provided
card issuing Institution pays the amount without deferment
to the merchant accepting the card.
2/7  Agency in trading in currencies
2/7/1 It is permissible to appoint an agent to execute a contract of
sale of a currency with authorisation to take possession of and
deliver the countervalue.
2/7/2 It is permissible to appoint an agent to sell currencies without
authorizing him to take possession of the amount sold, provided
the principal or another agent takes possession at the closing of
the transaction, before the principal parties are dispersed.
2/7/3 It is permissible to authorise taking possession of the counter-
values after the execution of a contract of currency exchange,
provided such possession is completed by the authorised agents
at the closing of the transaction, before the principal parties are
dispersed.
2/8  Use of modern means of communication for currency trading
2/8/1 Bilateral contracting between two parties at different remote
places  using  modern  communication  means  has  the  same
juristic consequences as execution of the contract in one and
ame place.
5555
Shariah Standard No. (1): Trading in Currencies
2/8/2 An offer made for a stated period, which is transmitted by one
of the prescribed means of communication, remains binding
on the offeror during that period. The contract is not completed
until acceptance by the offeree, and taking possession of the
countervalues (either actual or constructive) by both parties,
has taken place.
2/9  Bilateral promise to purchase and sell currencies
2/9/1  A bilateral promise to purchase and sell currencies is forbidden
if the promise is binding, even for the purpose of hedging against
currency devaluation risk. However, a promise from one party is
permissible even if the promise is binding.
2/9/2 Parallel purchase and sale of currencies is not permissible, as it
incorporates one of the following invalidating factors:
 a) There is no delivery and receipt of the two currencies bought
and sold, and thus the contract amounts to a deferred sale of
currency.
b) Making  a  contract  of  currency  exchange  conditional  on
another contract of currency exchange.
c) A bilateral promise that is binding on both parties to the
contract of currency exchange, and this is not permissible.
2/9/3 It is not permissible
2/9/3 It is not
 for one of the partners in Musharakah or
permissible for one of the partners in Musharakah or
Mudarabah to be a guarantor for the other partner, to protect
the latter from the risks of dealing in currencies. However, it
is permissible for a third party to volunteer being a guarantor
for that purpose, provided this guarantee is not stated in the
contract.
2/10 Exchange of currencies that are debts owed by the parties
  An exchange of amounts denominated in currencies that are debts
established as an obligation on the debtor is permissible, if this results
in the settlement of the two debts in place of a bilateral exchange of
currencies, and in the fulfilment of the obligations in respect of these
debts. This covers the following cases:
5656
Shariah Standard No. (1): Trading in Currencies
2/10/1 Discharge  of  two  debts  when  one  party  owes  an  amount
from another party denominated in (say) dinar and the other
party owes an amount from the first party denominated in
(say)  dirham.  In  this  context,  both  may  agree  on  the  rate
of  exchange  between  the  dinar  and  the  dirham  in  order
to  extinguish  the  debts,  wholly  or  partially.  This  type  of
transaction is known as al-Muqassah
transaction is known as
 (set-off).
al-Muqassah (set-off).
2/10/2 The  creditors  making  payment  of  a  debt  due  to  him  in
a currency different from that in which the debt was incurred,
provided the settlement is effected as a spot transaction at
the spot exchange rate on the day of settlement.
2/11 Combination of currency exchange and transfer of money
It is permissible to execute a financial transfer of money (remittances)
in a currency different from that presented by the applicant for the
transfer.  This  transaction  consists  of  a  currency  exchange  effected
through actual or constructive possession by delivering an amount
of currency that is evidenced by a bank draft, followed by the transfer
of the amount using currency that is bought by the applicant for the
transfer of money. It is permissible for the Institution to charge a fee
for the transfer.
2/12 Forms of dealing in currencies via Institutions
2/12/1 Among the forms that are not permitted is the customer of
an Institution entering into currency trading for an amount
of  money  exceeding  the  amount  of  money  he  owns,  using
credit facilities granted by the Institution which handles the
currency  trading,  thus  enabling  the  customer  to  enter  into
a  transaction  for  an  amount  in  excess  of  what  he  would
otherwise be able to pay for.
2/12/2 It is not permitted for the Institution to lend the customer
a  sum  of  money  on  the  condition  that  currency  dealing
must  be  effected  with  that  Institution  and  not  with  any
other. If there is no such condition, then there is no Shariah
prohibition.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
In its meeting No. (1) held in Bahrain on Saturday 11 Dhul-Qadah 1419
A.H., corresponding to 27 February 1998 A.D., the Shariah Board decided to
give priority to the preparation of a Shariah standard on Trading in Currencies.
On Saturday 11 Dhul-Qadah 1419 A.H., corresponding to 27 February
1999  A.D.,  a  Shariah  consultant  was  commissioned  to  prepare  a  juristic
study and an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 13-16 Rabi I, 1420 A.H., corresponding
to  27-30  June  1999  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Committee  discussed  the  juristic
study and made certain amendments to it. The committee also discussed
the exposure draft of the standard in its meeting No. (3) held in Bahrain
on 9-11 Rajab 1420 A.H., corresponding to 18-20 October 1999 A.D., and
asked the consultant to make some amendments in light of the comments
made by the members.
The revised exposure draft of the standard was presented to the Shariah
Board in its meeting No. (2) held in Mecca on 10-15 Ramadan 1420 A.H.,
corresponding  to  18-22  December  1999  A.D.  The  Shariah  Board  made
further  amendments  to  the  exposure  draft  of  the  standard  and  decided
that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties in order to
obtain their comments in order to discuss them in a public hearing.
A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 2930 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H.,
corresponding  to  4-5  April  2000  A.D.  The  Public  hearing  was  attended
by more than 30 participants representing central banks, Institutions, ac-
counting firms, Shariah scholars, academics and others who are interested
in this field. Members of the Shariah Studies Committee responded in the
6060
Shariah Standard No. (1): Trading in Currencies
public hearing to the written comments as well as to the oral comments
that were expressed in the public hearing.
The  Shariah  Studies  Committee  held  its  meeting  No.  (5)  on  22-24
Muharram 1421 A.H., corresponding to 26-28 April 2000 A.D, to discuss
the  comments  made  about  the  exposure  draft.  The  Committee  made
the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary in light of both
the  discussions  that  took  place  in  the  public  hearing  and  the  written
comments that were received.
The  Shariah  Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (4)  on  2527  Safar  1421  A.H.,
corresponding to 2931 May 2000 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah
discussed the amendments made by the Shariah Studies Committee, and
made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary. The standard
was adopted by the majority vote of the members of the Shariah Board, as
recorded in the minutes of the Shariah Board.

every currency is considered as a kind of money on its own, like that of gold and silver,
and therefore it is permissible to sell a particular currency such as dollar, for another
currency such as Indian Rupee even for inequality as it is permissible to sell gold for
silver for a different weight, provided the bilateral taking possession of the two counter
values ( two currencies) must take place in the session of the contract. However, if
a certain amount of a particular currency is sold for the same currency such as Indian

country is considered as being of a kind that is different from that of other
countries as they are constructive money according to the decision of the
International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(5)(5) Therefore, these currencies differ
International Islamic Fiqh Academy.
 Therefore, these currencies differ
in kind according to the authority that considers them as money.
On this basis, it has been a condition, in the exchange of currencies that
are of the same kind, that equality in amount as well as taking possession of
the two countervalues before the two contracting parties depart the place
of the closing of the contract. However, if the kind of the currencies to be
exchanged is different, then it is permissible for the amounts to be different,
but the condition of taking possession of the countervalues before the two
contracting parties leave the place of signature of the contract shall prevail.
Shariah Ruling on Trading in Currencies
The original ruling on trading in currencies is that it is permissible, as
it falls under the general Islamic provisions regarding the permissibility of
selling gold, silver and money because this is one means of earning a profit.
This ruling is applicable as long as there is no reason for considering the
dealing as prohibited or objectionable. The basis of this ruling is the Hadith
that  are  available  with  regard  to  exchange  of  currencies  and  the  general
ruling  that  is  derived  from  these  Hadith  as  decided  by  the  jurists  in  the
chapter on currency exchange. Whenever one of the Shariah precepts is
not met, then the dealing is not permissible.
Stipulation of Equality and Taking Possession
While equality of the countervalues and concurrent taking of possession
are  required  in  the  exchange  of  two  similar  kinds  of  currencies,  only
bilateral taking of possession is required in the exchange of two dissimilar
kinds, based on the basis stated in (1) above.
Constructive Possession
Constructive possession as in the forms mentioned in the standard
is on an equal footing with actual possession, because the Shariah never
prescribed a particular method for taking possession. Therefore, reference
must be made to the prevailing custom in the business community which

results in the ability to dispose of the currency for the intended purpose
and transfer of the risk of the currency to the transferee, as in the forms
mentioned in the standard.
As for the various forms of constructive possession, there is a decision
issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy,(6)(6) and the various Fatwa

a guarantee by one of the parties in Mudarabah or Musharakah transactions
to the other party, to indemnify him against currency risks.
Agency in Exchange of Currencies and Issue of Taking Possession
Agency  in  exchange  of  currencies  is  permissible  because  agency  is
permissible with regard to an activity that the principal could undertake
personally.  As  one  could  undertake  the  exchange  himself,  then  it  is  also
permissible for him to authorise its undertaking by others on his behalf.
However,  since  taking  possession  of  the  countervalues  immediately
after  concluding  the  contract  has  been  a  juristic  condition,  the  juristic
requirement in the case of agency would be the taking possession by the
parties  to  the  contract  of  exchange,  whether  through  principal  or  agent.
When the agency is for the purpose of taking possession only, the juristic
rule relates to the leaving of the place of execution of the contract by both
principals before possession is taken, and not to the agents doing so.

would cover all contemporary means such as telex, fax, internet, etc.
Bilateral Promise in Exchange of Currencies
The prohibition of a binding bilateral promise in an exchange of currencies
is  supported  by  the  majority  of  Shariah  jurists,  because  binding  bilateral
promises from two parties are equivalent to a contract, and also for the reason
that the bilateral promise is not immediately followed by taking possession
of the countervalues, since it is not the wish of the parties to take possession
at that time.
Financial Institutions have a customary practice of treating promises as
binding, even when formally they are not. A promise from one party only
(as  opposed  to  a  bilateral  promise)  is  permissible  in  currency  exchange,
even if it is binding.
Exchange of Currencies that Are Owed by the Parties
The basis of the permissibility of an exchange of amounts denominated
in currencies that are debts established as an obligation of the debtor, on
the condition that the two obligations are thereby settled, is that this would
entail the settlement of the debt by discharging it. This does not involve
any prohibited transaction pertaining to debts either with regard to sale or
purchase.
As for some of the forms mentioned in the standard, there are texts to
support them, inter alia, the Hadith reported on the authority of Ibn Umar
(may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I have met the Prophet (peace be
upon him) at the house of Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her). And I said
to him: O Prophet of Allah, I would like to ask you; I sell a camel in Al-Baqi
for a price quoted in dinar but I take dirham, and I sell for a price quoted in
dirham but I take dinars, I take this from this and I give this from this. The
Prophet (peace be upon him) replied:

Shariah Standard No. (1): Trading in Currencies
Combination of Currency Exchange and Transfer of Money
The basis of the permissibility of the combination of currency exchange
and  transfer  of  money  is  the  achievement  of  constructive  possession  by
virtue of a bank draft for the amount that is given in one currency in return
for an amount paid in another currency for the purpose of its transfer. In this
regard, there is a decision by the International Islamic Academy of Fiqh that
reads: If a transfer of money is to be made in a currency different from the
currency of the amount paid by the applicant, then the transaction is based
on currency exchange and transfer of money. The currency exchange takes
place before the transfer, that is, the customer pays the amount of money to
the bank and the bank, after agreeing on the currency exchange rate that is
printed on the receipt delivered to the customer, issues a bank draft on the
(11)
basis of transfer of debt in the sense that has been mentioned.(11)
basis of transfer of debt in the sense that has been mentioned.
Forms of Trading in Currencies
The following form is not permissible: providing a type of financial facility
to a customer who wishes to engage in currency trading which enables him
to deal in amounts that he does not own and to sell amounts that he does
not own. An alternative and permissible form is that the Institution lends
the money to the customer so that the latter would then deal in amounts that
he owns. However, this would not be permissible if the Institution made it
a condition of the loan that the customer must carry out the currency trading
with the Institution, as this would involve a combination of both loan and
contract of exchange. This is not permissible because it results in a benefit

2. Characteristics of Different Types of Card
  While some of the characteristics are common to more than one type of
card, some are specific to a particular type of card.
2/1  Characteristics of the debit card
2/1/1 The Institution issues the card to a customer with available
funds in his account.
2/1/2 The card confers on its holder the right to withdraw cash from
his  account  or  to  pay  for  goods  or  services  purchased  up  to
the limit of the available funds (credit balance) on his account.
The debit to the customers account will be immediate, and the
card does not provide him with any credit.
2/1/3 The customer will not normally pay any charges for using this
card, except when it is used to withdraw cash or to purchase
another currency through another Institution different from
the Institution that has issued the card.
2/1/4 The issuing Institution may charge a fee for issuing the card,
or may make no charge for issuing it.
7272
Shariah Standard No. (2): Debit Card, Charge Card and Credit Card
2/1/5 Some  Institutions  charge  the  party  accepting  payment  by
means of the card a commission calculated as a percentage of
such payments.

a  prescribed  credit  period  following  receipt  of  a  statement
sent by the Institution issuing the card.

a percentage commission from the party accepting the card
on purchases made by using the card.
2/2/6 The  Institution  issuing  the  card  is  obliged  to  pay  the  party
accepting  the  card  for  purchases  made  by  the  cardholder,
within  a  specified  transaction  credit  limit  (or  the  agreed

for the cardholders purchases is direct, and is independent of
the relationship between the party accepting the card and the
cardholder.
2/2/7 The Institution issuing the card has a personal and direct right
against the cardholder to be reimbursed for any payments made
on his behalf. The issuers right is absolute and independent of
7373

the card in accordance with the contract between them.

and services and to withdraw cash, within the approved credit
limit.
2/3/3 When  purchasing  goods  or  services,  the  cardholder  is  given
a free credit period during which the amount due should be
paid and no interest is chargeable. The cardholder is also al-
lowed to defer paying the amount due and is charged interest
for the duration of the credit. In the case of a cash withdrawal,
there is no free credit period.

No. (1) held in Bahrain on Saturday 11 Dhul-Qadah 1419
A.H., corresponding to 27 February 1998 A.D., the Shariah Board decided
to  give  priority  to  the  preparation  of  a  Shariah  standard  on  debit  card,
charge card and credit card.
On Saturday 11 Dhul-Qadah 1419 A.H., corresponding to 27 February
1999  A.D.,  a  Shariah  consultant  was  commissioned  to  prepare  a  juristic
study and an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 13-16 Rabi I, 1420 A.H., corresponding
to  27-30  June  1999  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Studies  Committee  discussed  the
juristic study and inserted certain amendments to it. The committee also
discussed the exposure draft of the standard in its meeting No. (3) held in
Bahrain on 9-11 Rajab 1420 A.H., corresponding to 18-20 October 1999
A.D. and, asked the consultant to make the necessary amendments in light
of the comments made by the members.
The revised exposure draft of the standard was presented to the Shariah
Board in its meeting No. (2) held in Mecca on 10-15 Ramadan 1420 A.H.,
corresponding  to  18-22  December  1999  A.D.  The  Shariah  Board  made
further amendments to the exposure draft of the standard and decided that
it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties to obtain their
comments in order to discuss them in a public hearing.
A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 2930 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H.,
corresponding  to  4-5  April  2000  A.D.  The  public  hearing  was  attended
by  more  than  30  participants  representing  central  banks,  Institutions,
accounting firms, Shariah scholars, academics and others who are interested
in this field. Members of the Shariah Studies Committee responded in the

Shariah Standard No. (2): Debit Card, Charge Card and Credit Card
Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
1. Debit Cards
It is permissible to issue debit cards subject to the conditions mentioned in
the standard, because such issuance does not incur any Shariah prohibition.
2. Charge card
It is permissible to issue charge cards subject to the conditions mentioned
in the standard, because such issuance does not incur Shariah prohibition
and because the contract involved does not grant credit facilities to the
cardholder  in  exchange  for  interest.  Prohibition  might  be  caused  by
conditions incorporated in the contract, or by dealings of the cardholder,
which contravene the Shariah.
3. Credit card
It is prohibited to issue credit cards, as mentioned in the standard, where
such issuance is based on a contract granting the cardholder the right to
a revolving credit on terms that involve interest, because Riba is prohibited
in terms of either taking or giving. The prohibition of Riba is established
through Quranic Texts, direct and certain Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be
upon him) and the consensus of Muslim scholars, rendering its prohibition
well  known  in  the  Muslim  community  as  self-evident.  However,  the
issuance of credit cards free from Riba, or from any other legal prohibition,
is permissible.
4.  Institutions  affiliation  to  membership  of  international  card  regulatory
organizations  is  permissible  because  the  contracts  of  the  Institutions
with  those  organizations  are  free  from  Shariah  infringements.  The  fees
that  the  companies  pay  are  the  charges  for  the  services  rendered  by
international  organizations,  by  granting  a  license,  carrying  out  set-

off in transactions
and other services. The transactions do not relate to
off in transactions and other services. The transactions do not relate to
the  advance  of  loans  interest,  since  the  dealings  of  the  Institutions  are
confined to debit and charge cards that are free from any requirement to
pay interest. These dealings do not involve credit cards of the type that are
not permissible for the reason given above.
5.  It  is  permissible  for  Institutions  to  charge  the  party  accepting  a  card
commission based on the prices of purchases or services made with the
card, as this can be considered as partly a brokerage and marketing fee as
well as a service charge for the collection of the debt.
6. It is permissible for Institutions to charge the cardholder membership
or renewal or replacement fees, because these fees are in exchange for
the right given to the customer to carry the card and to benefit from its
services.
7. Purchasing  with  a  debit  card  constitutes  constructive  possession  as
endorsed  by  the  Shariah.  When  the  purchaser  receives  gold  or  silver
or currencies which he is buying, uses the card and signs the payment
coupon for the account of the party accepting the card, then constructive
possession takes place. This ruling is extracted from the decision of the
International Islamic Fiqh Academy(2)(2) which states that an accounting
International Islamic Fiqh Academy
 which states that an accounting
entry  is  considered  to  be  constructive  possession.  Thus,  the  legal
condition of taking possession is satisfied when using cards to purchase
gold or silver or currencies.

funds at the bank using the card, because this is to withdraw his own

may do so and has not stipulated that interest is payable on the such
amounts. This is a permissible loan.

a sum of money prior to receiving approval to use the card, then it is not

permitted for the Institution to prevent the cardholder from investing the
amount deposited in his account, as this would be tantamount to a loan
that draws extra benefit. For that reason, the appropriate alternative is
for amounts so deposited to be invested for the benefit of the cardholder
on the basis of profit and loss sharing.

Shariah Standard No. (3): Procrastinating Debtor
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers cases of default on the part of a solvent debtor or
solvent guarantor, and the case of a contractor or concessionaire who is
a a solvent guarantor, and the case of a contractor or concessionaire who is

2/1/2 It  is  not  permitted  to  stipulate  any  financial  compensation,
either  in  cash  or  in  other  consideration,  as  a  penalty  clause
in respect of a delay by a debtor in settling his debt, whether
or not the amount of such compensation is pre-determined;
this applies both to compensation in respect of loss of income
(opportunity loss) and in respect of a loss due to a change in
the value of the currency of the debt.
2/1/3 It is not permitted to make a judicial demand on a debtor in
default  to  pay  financial  compensation,  in  the  form  either  of

incurred by the creditor in order to recover his debt.
2/1/5  The creditor is entitled to apply for the sale of any asset mortgaged

courts.
2/1/6 Unless failure to pay was caused by force majeure, it is permis-
sible to stipulate that all outstanding instalments become due
once the procrastinating debtor fails to pay an instalment. It is
preferable that this clause is implemented only after notifying
the debtor and after the lapse of a reasonable period of time.
[see Shariah Standard No. (5) on Guarantees (item 5/1)]
2/1/7 In the case of a Murabahah sale, if the asset that was sold is still
available in the condition in which it was sold, and the buyer
has defaulted in the settlement of the price and has later become
bankrupt, then the seller (the Institution) is entitled to repossess
the asset instead of initiating procedures to obtain a bankruptcy
order.

as as Murabahah) to stipulate an undertaking by the debtor, that

b)  All rulings applicable to debtors in default are equally applicable
to guarantors in default.

Istisnaa and supply contracts. In case of a refusal to pay the amount due
under a penalty clause, the rulings relating to default by a debtor would
be applicable. It is permitted to deduct the amount from outstanding
amounts due to the contractor.

Shariah Standard No. (3): Procrastinating Debtor
2/4  Non-material punishments for default in payment
  The Institution is entitled to include the name of a debtor in default
in a list of undesirable customers (black list) and to send a warning
admonition to other companies about the defaulting debtor, either
when there is an inquiry from other companies about the debtor or
when such black lists are exchanged between companies directly.
2/5  General rulings
2/5/1 The Institution is entitled to [monitor and] investigate [the
financial status and activities] of a defaulting debtor through
all permissible and legitimate means.
2/5/2 The Institution may accept a payment from a debtor who is
in default that is in excess of the amount of the debt, provided
there is no contractual condition whether written or verbal,
or  custom  or  mutual  agreement  relating  to  this  additional
amount.
2/5/3 It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution  to  stipulate  in  a  contract
dealing with indebtedness that, if the debtor is late in making
payment, the Institution is entitled to recoup the amount due
from any of the accounts of the customer with the Institution,
whether  current  accounts  or  investment  accounts.  This  may
be  done  without  getting  any  further  consent  of  the  debtor
provided the balance in the account is of the same currency as
that of the debt. If, however, the currency is different, then the
rate of exchange to be used must be the then prevailing rate of
exchange.
2/6  Establishment of default in payment
  Default in payment is established when, following a normal demand
for payment, a debtor who has not proved that he is insolvent fails to
settle the debt on its due date.

On Saturday 11 Dhul-Qadah 1419 A.H., corresponding to 27 February
1999  A.D.,  a  Shariah  consultant  was  commissioned  to  prepare  a  juristic
study and an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 13-16 Rabi I, 1420 A.H., corresponding
to  27-30  June  1999  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Studies  Committee  discussed  the
juristic  study  and  introduced  certain  amendments  to  it.  The  Committee
further discussed the exposure draft of the standard in its meeting No. (3)
held in Bahrain on 9-11 Rajab 1420 A.H., corresponding to 18-20 October
1999  A.D.,  and  asked  the  consultant  to  make  additional  amendments  to
reflect the comments made by the members.
The revised exposure draft of the standard was presented to the Shariah
Board in its meeting No. (2) held in Mecca on 10-15 Ramadan 1420 A.H.,
corresponding  to  18-22  December  1999  A.D.  The  Shariah  Board  made
further  amendments  to  the  exposure  draft  of  the  standard,  and  decided
that the amended exposure draft should be distributed to specialists and
interested  parties  to  obtain  their  comments  in  order  to  discuss  them  in
a public hearing.
A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 2930 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H.,
corresponding  to  4-5  April  2000  A.D.  The  public  hearing  was  attended
by more than 30 participants representing central banks, Institutions, ac-
 are interested

in this field. Members of the Shariah Studies Committee responded to the
written comments that were sent prior to the public hearing as well as to
the oral comments that were expressed in the public hearing.
The  Shariah  Studies  Committee  held  its  meeting  No.  (5)  on  22-24
Muharram 1421 A.H., corresponding to 26-28 April 2000 A.D., to discuss
the  comments  made  about  the  exposure  draft.  The  Committee  made
the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary in light of both
the  discussions  that  took  place  in  the  public  hearing,  and  the  written
comments that were received.
The Shariah Board in its meeting No. (4) held on 2527 Safar 1421 A.H.,
corresponding to 26-28 May 2000 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah
discussed  the  amendments  made  by  the  Shariah  Studies  Committee,
and  made  the  necessary  amendments,  which  deemed  necessary.  Some
paragraphs  of  the  standard  were  adopted  by  the  unanimous  vote  of  the
members of the Shariah Board, while the other paragraphs were adopted
by  the  majority  vote  of  the  members,  as  recorded  in  the  minutes  of  the
Shariah Board.
The Shariah Standards Review Committee reviewed the standard in its
meeting held in Muharram 1433 A.H., corresponding to November 2011
A.D., in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amend-
ments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary, and then
submitted the proposed amendments to the Shariah Board for approval as
it deemed necessary.
In its meeting No. (38) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia on 28 Shaban - 1 Ramadan 1435 A.H., corresponding to 26-
28 June 2014 A.D., the Shariah Board discussed the proposed amendments
submitted by the Shariah Standards Review Committee. After deliberation,
the Shariah Board approved the necessary amendments, and the standard
was adopted in its current amended version.

Default on the Part of a Debtor
The debtor must settle his debt when it is due. Default in payment by
a debtor who is able to settle the debt is prohibited. The Prophet (peace

Shariah Standard No. (3): Procrastinating Debtor
Stipulation of, or Legal Claim for, Compensation for Late Payment of
the Debt
It  is  not  permitted  to  stipulate  as  a  condition  of  a  contract  involving
indebtedness that in case of default the debtor should pay compensation,
or  to  have  a  legal  claim  for  compensation  against  a  defaulting  debtor,
whether such arrangements are made at the beginning of the contract or
on its maturity, since this would constitute Riba and any such stipulation
or  arrangement  is  null  and  void.  This  is  because  the  Prophet  (peace  be
Muslims are bound by their contractual conditions, except
upon him) says: Muslims are bound by their contractual conditions, except
upon him) says:
those  that  render  impermissible  what  is  permissible  or  render  permissible
what  is  impermissible.(6)(6)  There  is  also  the  reason  that,  during  the  pre-
what  is  impermissible.
  There  is  also  the  reason  that,  during  the  pre-
Islamic period, lenders who charged interest used to say to their debtors:
Do you want to settle now or to pay an additional amount for a further
period of credit?. The prohibition of any loan which requires a payment
in excess of the amount lent has also been reported on the authority of
many companions from the Prophet (peace be upon him). On this basis,
a decision was reached by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy which
reads  as  follows:  It  is  impermissible  from  the  Shariah  perspective  to
stipulate a condition of compensation in the case of delay in the settlement
of a debt.(7)(7)
of a debt.
No penalty clause may be applied in the case of a delay in settling a debt,
as any increase in the amount of the debt is Riba; this is in contrast to the
application of a penalty clause to other cases of delay, such as delay in fulfilling
construction or Istisnaa contracts. As the judgement on this issue by the court
is binding, it is therefore not permitted to stipulate such a condition directly
in the contract creating a debt or to enforce it subsequently by recourse to the
judiciary.

Disposal of a Mortgaged Asset
It is permissible for the creditor to demand the selling of a mortgaged

permissible for the creditor to obtain a mandate from the debtor to sell the

reasonable time for payment.
The Right to Repossess a Sold Asset
If an asset sold by Murabahah or another sales contract is still available to
the seller, and the purchaser has defaulted in the payment of the price, and
subsequently has become bankrupt, then the seller is entitled to repossess
the sold asset instead of initiating legal proceedings to obtain a bankruptcy
order. This judgement is based on the report of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah
be pleased with him) that the Prophet (prayers and peace of Allah be upon
him) said: If one party has sold an asset and the other party (the purchaser)
has become bankrupt, and the former party has managed to retain the asset,
then he is more qualified to take possession of the asset in preference to the
(12)
other creditors.(12)
other creditors.
A Commitment on the Part of the Debtor to Make a Donation in Case of
Default
The permissibility of stipulating a condition, whereby the debtor in case
of default is obliged to donate a sum of money (in addition to the amount of
the debt) to be spent by the creditor (the Institution) on charitable causes, is
because this has been considered as an instance of the commitment to make
a donation, which is well established in the Maliki school of law. This is the
opinion of Abu Abdullah Ibn Nafi and Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Dinar,

Guarantor
A  guarantor  is  liable  for  anything  for  which  the  debtor  whose  debt  is

another with respect to the liability. This is in line with the Quranic verse

refuses to pay, payment will be demanded from the guarantor, because this
sequence is a valid stipulation and believers are bound by their stipulations.

It is permissible to impose penalty clauses in contracts for constructions,
Istisnaa and supply contracts, as such clauses are included in what may be

Shariah Standard No. (3): Procrastinating Debtor
Non-Material Penalties Applied to the Debtor in Case of Default
The grounds for such penalties lie in the jurists decision which is based
on their interpretation of the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him):
Delay in payment by a solvent debtor would be a legal ground for his being

payment is not a prohibited slander; on the contrary, there is an obligation
to warn other companies about his character, as this falls under the category
of advice which it is a duty to give.
General Provisions
a) The  monitoring  of  the  affairs  of  the  default  debtor,  is  a  kind  of
pursuing that has been established by the Shariah jurists. This pursuit
is intended to make recovery from the defaulting debtor out of assets
that he may have concealed from the knowledge of the creditor. In
the circumstances, such pursuit does not constitute interference in
the affairs of others.
b) The debtor may, entirely at his own discretion without any condition
or customary practice, pay an additional amount when settling the
debt, and this is part of good settlement following the saying of Allah:
(...No  ground  (of  complaint)  can  there  be  against  the  Muhsinun

(peace be upon him), occasionally used to pay an additional amount
when settling a debt. The permissibility of this practice depends on
the discretionary nature of this extra payment and the absence of any
stipulation or customary practice of making such a payment, since
the  existence  of  such  a  customary  practice  would  be  inconsistent
with the condition that the extra payment be entirely discretionary
and not stipulated.
c) It is permissible to accept the extra amount paid by the debtor following
the proofs mentioned earlier.

Shariah Standard No. (4): Settlement of Debts by Set-Off
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers the settlement of debt by way of set-off. The standard
shall not apply to discharge of liability by way of transfer, waiving of obli-
gation, composition, acquisition of a right payable or bilateral cancellation
of a contract, as they are covered by their respective Standards.
2. Definition of Set-Off and Its Various Forms
  A set-off is to extinguish a debt receivable by a debt payable. It is divided
into two main forms: mandatory set-off and contractual set-off.
2/1  Mandatory set-off
  A  mandatory  set-off  is  a  set-off  that  occurs  without  the  need  for
bilateral agreement or consent of both indebted parties and, in some
cases of mandatory set-off, it is one party that is forced to comply with
the request of the other party for set-off. It is divided into compulsory
set-off (on both parties)(2)(2) and set-off on demand (of the person with
set-off (on both parties)
 and set-off on demand (of the person with
the superior debt whereby the other party is obliged to comply with
the demand).
2/1/1 A compulsory set-off is the spontaneous discharge of two debts
that is not contingent on the request or consent of both or either
party.
2/1/2 The conditions of the permissibility of compulsory set-off are
the following:
a) Each party should be a creditor and debtor simultaneously.
b) Both debts should be equal in kind, type, description and
maturity. However, if the two debts are not equal in amount,
a  set-off  will  take  place  of  an  equivalent  amount  on  both
 Compulsorily set-off is a set-off that occurs without a need to bilateral agreements or

consents of the parties.

sides, and the party that is owed the larger debt will remain
a creditor for the remaining balance.
c) Neither of the two debts should be encumbered by an obliga-
tion to a third party, such as the right of a mortgagee to one of
the debts. The intention of this is to protect rights associated
with the amount of the debt and belonging to third parties.
d) The set-off should not be arranged in a manner that results in

violation of a rule of Shariah, such as Riba (usury) or Shubhat
violation of a rule of Shariah, such as Riba (usury) or
 (a transaction potentially involving Riba).
al-Riba (a transaction potentially involving Riba).
al-Riba
2/1/3 A set-off on demand is the discharge of two debts at the request
of the creditor for the superior debt and his consent to forgo the
excess of the amount or privilege he is owed over what he owes.
This set-off will take place whether or not the creditor for the
smaller debt consents.
2/1/4 The conditions of permissibility of a set-off on demand are the
following:
a) Each party should be a creditor and debtor simultaneously.
b) The creditor for the superior debt, in terms of quality and
duration, should consent to relinquish his additional right
or privilege. An example of superiority in terms of quality
is when the debt is secured by a mortgage, or when a third
party has given a guarantee to pay the debt, and the owner
of the secured debt consents to relinquish this guarantee.
Superiority  in  terms  of  duration  exists  if  the  duration  of
one of the debts is shorter, or one debt is now due and the
other is not yet due. In these cases, the debt which has the
shorter duration or which is now due is superior.
c) Both  debts  should  be  similar  in  kind  and  type,  but  not
necessarily  in  quality  and  date  of  maturity.  However,  if
the two debts are not equal in amount, a set-off will take
place of an equivalent amount on both sides, and the party
that is owed the larger debt will remain a creditor for the
remaining balance.
109109
Shariah Standard No. (4): Settlement of Debts by Set-Off
d) The set-off should not be arranged in a manner that results
in  violation  of  a  rule  of  Shariah,  such  as  Riba  (usury)  or
 a transaction potentially involving Riba.
2/2  Contractual set-off
2/2/1 A contractual set-off is the discharge of two debts by the consent
of the two parties to extinguish their obligations towards each
other.
2/2/2 The conditions of the permissibility of a contractual set-off are
the following:
a) Each party should be a creditor and debtor simultaneously.
b) The two parties should mutually consent to the set-off.
c) The set-off should not be arranged in a manner that results
in violation of a rule of Shariah, such as Riba or a transaction
potentially involving Riba.
2/2/3  A contractual set-off is permissible even without the need for two
debts to be similar in kind, type, description or maturity. This is
because  the  agreement  on  contractual  set-off  means  that  each
party has agreed to relinquish any extra privilege associated with
his debt. A contractual set-off is also permissible if the two debts
are  not  equal  in  terms  of  amount,  in  which  case  a  set-off  will
take place of an equivalent amount on both sides, and the party
that is owed the larger debt is entitled to request payment of the
remaining balance. [see item 2/10 (a) of the Shariah Standards
on Trading in Currencies]
3. Bilateral Exchange of Promises to Conclude a Set-Off in the Future
It is permissible for the Institution and its customers or other Institutions
to  exchange  bilateral  promises  that  debts  that  may  be  created  between
them in the future will be settled by way of set-off, in which case all the
conditions mentioned in the items 2/1 and 2/2 will be applicable at the
time of actual set-off. However, if the currencies of the two debts differ,
a bilateral exchange of promise of set-off should be concluded on the basis
110110
Shariah Standard No. (4): Settlement of Debts by Set-Off
that a set-off will take place based on the current currency exchange rate
at the time of actual set-off; this ruling is to prevent the practices of Riba
by roundabout methods or by implied agreement for practicing Riba.
4. Application of the Rules of Set-Off to Some Modern Transactions
  The followings are some rules of set-off to modern transactions:
4/1  Stipulating set-off between the customer and the Institution in respect
of debts to the Institution arising out of sales on deferred payment. The
agreement on contractual set-off of future debts, commonly known as
set-off  and  consolidation,  is  a  practice  employed  by  a  large  number
of  financial  Institutions.  This  form  of  set-off  may  take  place  either
compulsorily or contractually depending on whether the situation that
gives rise to this set-off meets the conditions of compulsory set-off or
the conditions of contractual set-off. Moreover, by pre-stipulating this
type of set-off in the agreement, a fresh agreement may be avoided at
the time of set-off when the two currencies are different or when one
of the debts is superior to the other.
4/2  A  set-off  may  take  place  between  a  financial  Institution  accepting
 a cheque and the drawer of the cheque, through the clearing-house.
This  form  of  set-off  may  also  take  place  either  compulsorily  or
contractually depending on whether the state that gives rise to this
set-off meets the conditions of compulsory set-off or the conditions
of contractual set-off.
4/3 Set-off  that  is  concluded  among  financial  Institutions  through
international or national networking systems, such as credit card
or  debit  card  organisations.  This  form  of  set-off  may  be  either
compulsory  or  contractual  depending  on  whether  the  state  that
gives rise to this set-off meets the conditions of compulsory set-off
or the conditions of contractual set-off.
5. Currency Swaps
  The currency swaps that are concluded on the basis of Riba are not permis-
sible. This is because in this process it is the interest-based securities that
are set-off against interest-based securities.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
In its meeting No. (2) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 10-14 Ramadan
1420 A.H., corresponding to 18-22 December 1999 A.D., the Shariah Board
decided to give priority to the preparation of a Shariah Standard on settlements
of debt by way of set-off.
On Tuesday 27 Ramadan 1420 A.H., corresponding to 4 January 2000
A.D., one Shariah consultant was commissioned to prepare a juristic study
and an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 18-19 Rabi I, 1421 A.H., corresponding
to  20-21  June  2000  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Studies  Committee  discussed  the
juristic  study  and  made  certain  amendments  to  it.  The  committee  also
discussed the exposure draft of the Standard in its meeting No. (6) held in
Bahrain on 20-21 Jumada II, 1421 A.H., corresponding to 18-19 September
2000 A.D., and asked the consultant to make some amendments in light of
the comments made by the members.

it deemed necessary.
In its meeting No. (38) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia on 28 Shaban to 1 Ramadan 1435 A.H., corresponding to 26-
28 June 2014 A.D., the Shariah Board discussed the proposed amendments
submitted by the Shariah Standards Review Committee. After deliberation,
the Shariah Board approved the necessary amendments, and the standard
was adopted in its current amended version.

Shariah Standard No. (4): Settlement of Debts by Set-Off
Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
The basis for debt settlements by way of set-off is that it has been practised
from  time  immemorial  without  any  report  of  disapproval.  Moreover,  set-
off is in line with the objectives of the Shariah as it encourages discharging
individuals from liability of debt and set-off is one way of discharging debt
liabilities without involving futile processes of debt recovery.
In addition, there is no Shariah objection to a set-off taking place on
demand. The authority for this permissibility is that the person entitled to
the superior debt has agreed to forgo the advantage attached to his debt
and the Shariah will not object to such a gesture.
If set-off is executed contractually, it is then based on the prophetic Hadith
stating;
Muslims are bound by the conditions and agreements they have made,
stating; Muslims are bound by the conditions and agreements they have made,
except a condition that has rendered the unlawful lawful or rendered the lawful

Appendix (C)
Definitions
Debt and Loan
A debt is any liability that is not in terms of a specified or defined item,
whatever the cause of its establishment, i.e. whether its origin is in cash or in
a commodity, or in a particular described benefit such as the benefit of using
particular things or services of persons. For instance, the consideration in
deferred sales and loans is described as a debt.
The relationship between a loan and a debt is that the latter is more general
than the former, since every loan is described as a debt but the converse is
not true. Not all debts originate from a loan. In this sense, a loan is but one
cause of the creation of debt.
Due Debt
A due debt is a debt that is immediately payable or that is payable on
the creditors demand, whether on its original due date or, if it has been
rescheduled and deferred, on its rescheduled due date.
Deferred Debt
A deferred debt is a debt the payment thereof is due at a certain time in
the future, and it may also be due in periodic instalments over time.
Description
A description is a condition that distinguishes particular specimens of the
same species from one other. For examples, conditions such as good quality
and poor quality, or mortgage of security or personal guarantees, letters of
guarantee and the freezing of the amount of cheques for payment which are
attached to the debt are considered descriptions.

Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers securities (Guarantees) intended to secure obligations
and protect debts against procrastination and default. Such securities may
take  the  form  of  written  documents,  attestations,  personal  guarantees,
mortgages, cheques and promissory notes. The standard also explains the
permissible and prohibited forms of securities. It also intends to distinguish
between liabilities and the assets held on trust.
  The standard does not cover guarantees against torts.
2. General Rulings on Guarantees
2/1  Permissibility of guarantees and their relevance to contracts
2/1/1 A contract of guarantee is permissible in contracts of exchange,
e.g. a contract of sale, or contract of rights, e.g. right of intel-
lectual property. Such a guarantee contract does not affect the
permissibility of the original contract in which it is required. It
is, moreover, permissible to stipulate a guarantee into the body
of an original at one time, because guarantee is appropriate to,
or relevant in, contracts.
2/1/2  There is no objection in Shariah to include a number of guaran-
tees in one contract, such as incorporating a personal guarantee
together with a mortgage of security in the same contract.
2/2  Guarantees in trust (fiduciary) contracts
2/2/1 It is not permissible to stipulate in trust (fiduciary) contracts,
e.g. agency contracts or contracts of deposits, that a personal
guarantee or mortgage of security be produced, because such
a stipulation is against the nature of trust (fiduciary) contracts,
unless such a stipulation is intended to cover cases of miscon-
124124
Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
duct,  negligence  or  breach  of  conditions  or  stipulations.  The
prohibition  against  seeking  a  guarantee  in  trust  contracts  is
more stringent in Musharakah and Mudarabah contracts, since
it is not permitted to require from a manager in the Mudara-
bah or the Musharakah contract or an investment agent or one
of the partners in these contracts to guarantee the capital, or
to promise a guaranteed profit. Moreover, it is not permissible
for these contracts to be marketed or operated as a guaranteed
investment.
2/2/2 It is not permissible to combine agency and personal guarantees
in one contract at the same time (i.e. the same party acting in
the capacity of an agent on one hand and acting as a guarantor
on the other hand), because such a combination conflicts with
the  nature  of  these  contracts.  In  addition,  a  guarantee  given
by a party acting as an agent in respect of an investment turns
the  transaction  into  an  interest-based  loan,  since  the  capital
of  the  investment  is  guaranteed  in  addition  to  the  proceeds
of  the  investment,  (i.e.  as  though  the  investment  agent  had
taken  a  loan  and  repaid  it  with  an  additional  sum  which  is
tantamount to Riba). But if a guarantee is not stipulated in the
agency contract and the agent voluntarily provides a guarantee
to his clients independently of the agency contract, the agent
becomes a guarantor in a different capacity from that of agent.
In this case, such an agent will remain liable as guarantor even
if he is discharged from acting as agent.
2/3  Guaranteeing existing leased properties
  The  lessor  bears  the  risk  associated  with  the  leased  property  and
the  lessee  holds  it  on  a  trust  basis.  Hence,  it  is  not  permissible  for
the  lessor  to  stipulate  in  the  lease  contract  that  the  lessee  provide
a  guarantee  or  mortgage  of  security,  etc.,  so  that  he  may  use  it  to
recover  the  amount  of  the  lease  rental  if  the  leased  property  is
damaged, unless such a stipulation is restricted to cases of misconduct,
negligence or breach of contract. Therefore, the lessor is liable for the
consequences of any damage to the leased property that is not caused
125125
Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
by the misconduct or negligence of the lessee, and is responsible for
any related insurance expenses. The lessor also bears the expense of
any  major  maintenance  work  required  to  keep  the  leased  property
in the condition necessary to provide the contractual benefits under
the lease.
2/4  Written documentation and attestation
2/4/1  Documentation in writing is recommended by Shariah, whether
such  documentation  is  in  the  form  of  ordinary  (private)  or
official documents.  However, customary practice is applicable
in the drawing up of such documents and in determining the
documents that are relevant as proof (or have evidential value).
It is prohibited to forge documents or to conceal their contents
or to destroy them so as to bring about the loss of other peoples
rights.
2/4/2  Attestation in financial transactions is recommended by Shariah.
It is also commendable, and in case of necessity it is obligatory,
to give testimony. On the other hand, perjury is prohibited and
is one of the major sins.
2/4/3 It  is  not  permitted  to  scribe  or  witness  acts  prohibited  by
Shariah, such as certifying or witnessing borrowing on the
basis of interest.
3. Personal Guarantees
3/1  Permissibility and types of personal guarantee
3/1/1 It is permissible for an Institution to stipulate that a customer
should provide one or more guarantors to secure the debts
owed by the customer.
3/1/2 Personal  guarantees  are  divided  into  two  types.  One  type  is
a guarantee where the guarantor has a right of recourse to the
debtor, and this guarantee is offered at the request or with the
consent of the debtor. The other type is a non-recourse guar-
antee, which is offered voluntarily by a third party without the
debtors request or consent (voluntary guarantee).
126126
Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
3/1/3 An  Institution  is  not  entitled  to  guarantee  financial  com-
mitments without a right of recourse to the debtor, i.e. to be
a  non-recourse  guarantor,  unless  the  Institution  is  already
authorised by its shareholders and investors to make dona-
tions or to perform acts of benevolence.
3/1/4 It is permissible to fix the duration of a personal guarantee. It is
also permissible to set a ceiling on the amount to be guaranteed
and it is permissible that the personal guarantee be restricted by,
or be contingent upon, a condition. In addition, it is permissible
that such a guarantee be made contingent upon a future event,
for example, by fixing a future date at which liability will com-
mence  and,  in  this  case,  the  guarantor  may  validly  withdraw
the guarantee, by notifying the creditor, before the prospective
obligation to be guaranteed arises.
3/1/5 It is not permissible to take any remuneration whatsoever for
providing a personal guarantee per se, or to pay commission for
obtaining such a guarantee. The guarantor is, however, entitled
to claim any expenses actually incurred during the period of
a  personal  guarantee,  and  the  Institution  is  not  obliged  to
inquire as to how the guarantee produced has been obtained
by the customer. [see item 7/1/1 and 7/1/2)]
3/2  Guaranteeing unknown (Majhul) and future debts
  A valid guarantee may be given for debts, the exact amount of which
is unknown. Similarly, a valid guarantee may be given for a debt that
will arise in the future. However, it is permissible for the guarantor
to withdraw such a guarantee before a future debt is actually created,
after  notifying  the  person  having  interest  in  the  guarantee.  This  is
called a market (business) guarantee, or a guarantee of contractual
obligation.  An  example  of  this  type  is  a  third  partys  guarantee  to
refund the price to the buyer if it appears that the sold commodity
belongs to a person other than the seller and this guarantee is known
  (dealers/business misrepresentation guarantee).

Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
3/3  The effect of a personal guarantee
3/3/1 The creditor is entitled to claim the amount of his debt from
either  the  debtor  or  the  guarantor  and  he  has  the  choice  of
claiming his right from either of them. However, the guarantor
is  entitled  to  arrange  the  order  of  liability,  for  example,  by
stipulating (at the conclusion of the contract of guarantee) that
the creditor shall first claim payment from the principal debtor
and  that  the  creditor  is  entitled  to  recourse  to  the  guarantor
for  payment  only  if  the  principal  debtor  refuses  to  fulfil  his
obligation.
3/3/2  If the creditor discharges the debtor from the debt, the guarantor
is also discharged automatically from his liability. However,
is also discharged automatically from his liability.
However,
if  the  creditor  discharges  the  guarantor  from
liability,  the
if  the  creditor  discharges  the  guarantor  from  liability,  the
debtor remains in debt. If the guarantor secures a discount
that results in paying an amount less than the original debt,
the guarantor is entitled to recover only the amount he has
actually  paid  to  the  creditor;  he  cannot  demand  that  the
debtor pay the debt in full ignoring the discount. This rule is
intended to prevent a procedure being used that potentially
leads to Riba. However, if the guarantor reaches an agreement
with  the  creditor  to  settle  the  debt  using  as  consideration
a commodity of a different type from that in which the original
debt was designated, the guarantor is entitled to recover the
exact amount of the commodity provided as consideration for
the debt, or the exact amount of the debt, whichever is less.
3/3/3 It is permissible for a personal guarantee contract to be desig-
nated in a separate contract. It can also be concluded togeth-
er with, or before, or after, the conclusion of the contract of
a credit transaction.
3/3/4  If an Institution manages transactions on the basis of Mudarabah
or Musharakah or investment agency, it is not permitted for it to
guarantee the fluctuations of currency exchange rates so that the
of the
investment shares irrespective of the
investors will recover their investment shares irrespective
investors will recover their
behaviour of the currency market. Such a guarantee is prohibited
128128
Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
because it is tantamount to the Mudarib or partner or investment
agent  guaranteeing  the  capital  of  other  partners  or  investors,
which is prohibited by Shariah. [see items 2/21 and 2/2/2]
3/3/5 If the contract of a credit transaction stipulates that the debtor
shall provide a guarantor and the debtor fails to provide one,
the Institution is entitled to initiate legal action to force him to
provide a guarantor or to terminate the contract.
4. Mortgage (Rahn)
It is to make a financial asset or so tied to a debt so that the asset or its
value is used for repayment of the debt in case of default. [see Shariah
Standard No. (39) on Mortgage]
5. Cases of Achieving the Objectives of Securities
5/1  Bringing forward future instalments in case of default on payment
It is permissible to include a term in a debt contract to the effect that,
if the debtor defaults on the payment of one or more instalments, some
or all of the future instalments shall fall due immediately, provided the
default  was  not  caused  by  unforeseeable  intervening  events  or  force
majeure. However, this term shall not be effective until the debtor has
been served with a reminder notice and after a reasonable period of
time has elapsed.
5/2  Termination of a sale on deferred payment terms in case of failure
to pay
  The seller is entitled, in a contract of sale on a deferred payment basis,
to stipulate that if the buyer fails to pay the price within a certain period
of time, the seller is entitled to revoke the contract and repossess the
sold asset without recourse to the courts.
6. Some Contemporary Applications of Securities
6/1  Letters of guarantee
6/1/1 It is not permissible to take remuneration for issuing a letter
of guarantee, whether it is with cover or without cover, if the
remuneration is  intended  as consideration for  the  guarantee
remuneration is intended as consideration for the guarantee
129129
Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
per se
, since the amount guaranteed and the duration of the
per se, since the amount guaranteed and the duration of the
guarantee are usually taken into consideration in computing
remuneration.
 6/1/2 Asking an applicant for a letter of guarantee to bear administrative
expenses incurred in issuing a letter of guarantee of either type
(i.e. preliminary or final) is permissible in Shariah, provided the
remuneration for such expenses do not exceed the commission
that others would charge for such services. Where full or partial
cover is provided, it is permissible, in estimating the expenses
for issuing a letter of guarantee, to take into account anything
that will reflect the actual service to be rendered in providing
a cover for the transaction.
6/1/3  It is not permitted for the Institution to issue a letter of guarantee
in favour of an applicant who will use it to acquire an interest-
based loan or to conclude a prohibited transaction.
6/2  Documentary credit
It is a written undertaking by a bank (known as the issuer) given to
the seller (the beneficiary) as per the buyers (applicants or orderers)
instruction  or  is  issued  by  the  bank  for  its  own  use,  undertaking
to pay up to a specified amount (in cash or through acceptance or
discounting of a bill of exchange), within a certain period of time,
provided that the seller present documents for the goods conforming
to the instructions.
In  brief,  a  documentary  credit  is  an  undertaking  by  a  bank  to  pay
subject to conformity of the documents to the contractual instructions.
[see Shariah Standard No. (14) on Documentary Credit]
6/3  Use of cheques or promissory notes
  There is no Shariah objection to obtaining cheques or promissory
notes from the debtor (unless not allowed by law) as a means to force
the debtor to make timely payment of instalments in cash, whereby
if the debtor pays on time such cheques or promissory notes shall
be  returned  to  him,  and  in  the  event  of  default  on  payment  they
130130
Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
may be produced for recovery. The party providing these cheques
or promissory notes as security is entitled to obtain an undertaking
from the Institution that they will be used only for timely recovery
of its due debts without any addition.
6/4  Insurance for doubtful or bad debts
It is permissible to subscribe to an Islamic insurance coverage as
security for debt obligations and it is not permissible that debts be
insured on a conventional insurance basis.
6/5  Freezing cash deposits (blocking withdrawals)
6/5/1 In  order  to  secure  the  future  payment  of  debts  on  a  single
payment  or  an  instalment  basis,  it  is  permissible  for  the  In-
stitution to stipulate, that it is entitled to freeze the customers
investment account, or to revoke his right to withdraw money
from such an account entirely or to block an amount in the
account equivalent to the debt, which is the preferred option.
Nevertheless, the customer remains entitled to share profits on
the whole balance of the investment account after deducting
the Institutions share for acting as a Mudarib.
6/5/2 In  a  credit  transaction,  it  is  not  permitted  for  the  Institution
to  stipulate  a  right  to  freeze  the  customers  current  account.
However, a stipulation of this kind is allowed where the customer
has freely, willingly and absolutely agreed to his current account
to be frozen.
6/6 Third party guarantees (voluntary undertakings to compensate
an investment loss)
It is permissible for a third party, other than the Mudarib or invest-
ment agent or one of the partners, to undertake voluntarily that he
will  compensate  the  investment  losses  of  the  party  to  whom  the
undertaking is given, provided this guarantee is not linked in any
manner to the Mudarabah financing contract or investment agen-
cy contract.

underwrite the remaining shares offered for subscription
after
underwrite the remaining shares offered for subscription after
the expiry of the offer period, provided the shares are under-
written at the offer value without any consideration for the
underwriting per se.
6/7/2  The underwriter is entitled to receive consideration for a service
it provides other than the guarantee, such as conducting a feasi-
bility study or marketing the shares.
6/8  Guarantees in tenders, security deposits in Murabahah transactions
and Arboun (Earnest Money)
6/8/1  It is permissible to obtain guarantees for tenders and this includes
both  the  amounts  paid  for  participating  in  the  bid  (primary
cash security for participating in the bid) and the amounts paid
when the contract is awarded to the successful bidder (final cash
security providing evidence of ability to complete the project).
Such amounts shall be considered as being held on trust by the
offeror  of  the  bid  on  behalf  of  the  successful  bidder,  and  are
not viewed as Arboun (Earnest Money). Hence, such amounts
are  recoverable  if  they  are  intermingled  with  other  amounts
of  money  (i.e.  irrespective  of  any  unwanted  circumstances).
Moreover,  it  is  not  permissible  to  confiscate  such  amounts  of
money,  except  in  compensation  for  an  equivalent  amount  of
financial  damage  actually  sustained  in  the  tendering  process.
Such amounts may be invested in the benefit of the customer
with  his  consent,  unless  he  requests  it  to  be  credited  to  his
current account.
6/8/2  It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution,  in  the  case  of  a  unilateral
binding promise, to take a sum of money called

6/8/3 It is permissible to take
Arboun from a buyer or lessee when
from a buyer or lessee when
a sale or lease contract is concluded, on condition that, if the
contract is not terminated within the specified period during
which the option to terminate the contract remains valid, such
an amount will be considered as part of the consideration for the
contract and, if the buyer or lessee fails to perform the contract
within this period, the seller or lessor is entitled to retain the
amount.      It  is,  however,  preferable  that  the  Institution  should

6/9  Priority right of recovery and the right to follow up
6/9/1 The  Institution  is  entitled  to  recover  first  its  tangible  items
that  were  sold  to  or  manufactured  for  a  customer  and  have
not been paid for and can be identified among the assets of the
customer.
6/9/2  The Institution is entitled to protect the integrity of the subject of
a guarantee, such as a mortgaged asset, and pursue a legal action
against misusing it if it is established that the person holding it
is using it in a manner that may lead to losses to be borne by the
Institution.
6/9/3  The rights of the parties holding mortgages of security shall be
given priority over the rights of the parties who are unsecured.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
In  its  meeting  No.  (2)  held  in  Mecca  on  10-14  Ramadan  1420  A.H.,
corresponding to 18-22 December 1999 A.D., the Shariah Board decided
to give priority to the preparation of a Shariah Standard on Guarantees.
On Tuesday 27 Ramadan 1420 A.H., corresponding to 4 January 2000
A.D., a Shariah consultant was commissioned to prepare a juristic study
and an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 18-19 Rabi I, 1421 A.H., corresponding
to  20-21  June  2000  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Committee  discussed  the  juristic
study and made certain amendments to it. The committee also discussed
the exposure draft of the Standard in its meeting No. (6) held in Bahrain
on 20-21 Jumada II, 1421 A.H., corresponding to 18-19 September 2000
A.D., and asked the consultant to make some amendments in light of the
comments made by the members.
In its meeting No. (7) held in Bahrain on 5-6 Shaban 1421 A.H., corre-
sponding to 1-2 November 2000 A.D., the Shariah Committee discussed
the exposure draft and made some relevant amendments.
The revised exposure draft of the standard was presented to the Shariah

that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties in order to
obtain their comments in order to discuss them in a public hearing.
A  public  hearing  was  held  in  Bahrain  on  4-5  Dhul-Hajjah  1421  A.H.,
corresponding to 27-28 February 2001 A.D. The public hearing was attended
136136
Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
by  more  than  30  participants  representing  central  banks,  Institutions,
accounting firms, Shariah scholars, academics and others who are interested
in this field. Members of the Shariah studies committee responded to the
written comments that were sent prior to the public hearing as well as to the
oral comments that were expressed in the public hearing.
The  Shariah  Committee  held  its  meeting  No.  (8)  on  16-17  Dhul-
Hajjah 1421 A.H., corresponding to 11-12 March 2001 A.D., to discuss
the comments made about the exposure draft. The committee made the
necessary amendments in light of both the written comments that were
received and oral comments that took place in the public hearing.
The  Shariah  Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (6)  held  in  Al-Madinah  Al-
Munawwarah on 25-29 Safar 1422 A.H., corresponding to 19-23 May 2001
A.D., discussed the amendments made by the Shariah Committee, and made
necessary amendments. The Shariah Board unanimously adopted some of
the items of the standard and some items were adopted by the majority vote
of  the  members  of  the  Shariah  Board,  as  recorded  in  the  minutes  of  the
meetings of the Shariah Board.
The  Shariah  Standards  Review  Committee  reviewed  the  standard  in
its  meeting  held  in  Muharram  1433  A.H.,  corresponding  to  November
2011 A.D., in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of
amendments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary,
and then submitted the proposed amendments to the Shariah Board for
approval as it deemed necessary.
In its meeting No. (38) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia on 28 Shaban - 1 Ramadan 1435 A.H., corresponding to 26-
28 June 2014 A.D., the Shariah Board discussed the proposed amendments
submitted by the Shariah Standards Review Committee. After deliberation,
the Shariah Board approved necessary amendments, and the standard was
adopted in its current amended version.

Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Permissibility of Guarantees and Its Relevance to Contracts
The basis of the permissibility of stipulating guarantees in contracts is
that it protects property, which is one of the objectives of Shariah. The other
authorities mentioned in the standard in support of each kind of guarantee
can be cited as authority for the permissibility of guarantees in contracts.
Guarantees in Trust Contracts
Assets  held  on  trust  must  be  returned  to  their  owners  in  the  manner
in which they were received and in their original physical state promptly
(Allah
after the owners demand their return. Allah, the Almighty, says: (Allah
after the owners demand their return. Allah, the Almighty, says:
doth command you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are
due).(2)(2) Since such assets are not subject to exchange, they are purposely
due).
 Since such assets are not subject to exchange, they are purposely
meant either for custody with permission to use them, such as assets on
deposit, or for charitable acts, such as a loan of tangible assets. Therefore,
the  persons  holding  such  assets  are  considered  by  the  owners  from  the
beginning as capable of returning them to their owners on demand, making
them trustees, and as a principle of Shariah, a trustee is not held liable (for
loss of, or damage to, an asset held on trust), except in circumstances of
misconduct, negligence or violation of the conditions agreed upon, because
in other circumstances it is inconsistent with the fundamental principle of
trusts for a trustee to be held liable.
Written Documentation and Attestation
Written documentation is recommended by Shariah. This is the opinion
of  the  majority  of  Fuqaha,  in  contrast  to  Ibn  Hazm  who  argued  that
written documentation is an obligation (i.e. if one did not put his financial

(O ye who believe! When you deal with

meaning of the Qura`nic verse:

time, reduce them to writing)(3)(3) and the Quranic Verse:

(Disdain not to
 and the Quranic Verse: (Disdain not to
reduce  to  writing  your  contract  for  a  future  period,  whether  it  be  small
or big.(4)(4)  The  majority  of  Fuqaha  have  also  inferred  that  this  verse  itself
or big.
  The  majority  of  Fuqaha  have  also  inferred  that  this  verse  itself
excluded written documentation in the cases of trustworthiness, as the last
(And if one of you deposits a thing on trust
part of the following verse says: (And if one of you deposits a thing on trust
part of the following verse says:
with another, let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust and left him
fear Allah his Lord.)
It  must  be  noted  that  customary  practice  is  the  basis  in  determining
the form and evidential value of written documentation, because Shariah
did not specify a particular manner of writing to be considered. As for the
permissibility of attestation as documentation, the authority for that is the
(And  get  out  two  witnesses,  out  of  your  own
following  Qura`nic  verse:  (And  get  out  two  witnesses,  out  of  your  own
following  Qura`nic  verse:
men. And if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as
ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind
her).(5)(5)
her).
The  evidential  value  of  attestation  according  to  traditional  Fuqaha  is
stronger than that of written documentation. But in modern times, things
have  changed  so  that  some  laws  rely  on  witnesses  only  in  a  very  limited
number of cases and paramount importance is given to written documentary
evidence.

The Fuqaha are unanimous on the permissibility of personal guarantees.
Moreover, the need of people for personal guarantees to facilitate dealings
with each other had also made them legitimate, particularly in the case of
customers who lack a good credit record. In addition, personal guarantees
encourage performance and prevent the contract from being breached and
this security also justifies their permissibility.
The objection to taking consideration for personal guarantees is that
giving  a  guarantee  is  one  of  the  charitable  acts  that  should  be  offered
without consideration, and this ruling has generated consensus among the
Fuqaha. Moreover, a personal guarantee indicates a readiness to give away
the amount of a loan, which means that the guarantor will pay the loan
(if the principal debtor fails to pay) and have recourse to the guaranteed
person for fulfilment. Hence, it is not permissible to take consideration for
a guarantee, because it is not permissible to take consideration for giving
away the amount of the loan itself, since such consideration is considered
to be Riba.

Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
this  Hadith  makes  no  distinction  between  guaranteeing  the  known  and
the unknown since there is no harm or element of dispute arising due to
uncertainty here, because the unknown transaction guaranteed will become
certain and known, and the guarantor will know, after the debt is incurred,
the actual obligation he undertakes. Another authority for the permissibility
(...for him who
of guaranteeing what is not known is the Quranic verse: (...for him who
of guaranteeing what is not known is the Quranic verse:

produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load and I will be bound by it.(10)
produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load and I will be bound by it.
Here, the guarantor guaranteed a camel load although it was not yet a debt.
The  evidence  for  the  creditors  right  to  demand  payment  from  either
the debtor or the guarantor is that the debt is established as liability of both
of  them,  hence  the  right  to  demand  payment  from  either  of  them.  The
permissibility for stipulating that the creditor has first to ask for payment
from the principal debtor and that he may ask the guarantor for payment
only if the debtor fails to pay, is based on an opinion in the Maliki school
(12) These opinions argued
of lawof law(11)
 These opinions argued
that if the debtor is solvent then demanding payment from the guarantor is
pointless, unless the debtor refuses to pay. So, the requirement that payment
be first sought from the debtor has a Shariah basis as well as being a case of
adherence to a principle of natural justice.
 and it is also an opinion of the Hanafis.(12)

(13)  and  because

choose to pay before time and relinquish the deferral of the date of payment

time. The basis of the rule enabling the creditor to demand payment of all
instalments in the event of default, instead of waiting until each instalment

is  due,  is  the  possibility  that  during  the  period  of  delay  in  payment  the
debtor may find a means to conceal his assets and claim insolvency. The
permissibility  of  this  condition  is  confirmed  by  the  Resolution  No.  (51)
issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.
Termination of a Sale on Deferred Payment Terms in Case of Failure to Pa
The basis for this is that the seller has consented to deferred payment
only if it will not lead to a loss of what is due to him. This is the opinion of
the majority of Fuqaha, as opposed to the Hanafis who have confined the
creditors right to litigation, unless he has stipulated the right to terminate
the contract and Muslims are bound by conditions they made.
Guarantees and Their Modern Applications
 Letters of Guarantee
The basis of the rule that no remuneration may be taken for a guarantee
per se is that it is a surety, and as such it is one of the contracts of charity since
it involves a readiness to give away the amount of a loan for no consideration.
The majority of Fuqaha agree that it is prohibited to take consideration for
guarantee. However, issuing the letter of guarantee is a service that justifies
charging fees.
The  prohibition  of  issuing  a  letter  of  guarantee  for  unlawful  acts  is
analogous  to  the  prohibition  of  giving  assistance  in  committing  a  sin.
The Hadith: Allah curses the one who gives Riba and the one who takes it
The Hadith:
Allah curses the one who gives Riba and the one who takes it
(14)    also
and the one who writes its contract and the two witnesses involved(14)
and the one who writes its contract and the two witnesses involved
also
supports this ruling, because the personal guarantor has a stronger role in
establishing and recovering a debt than the writer of the contract and the
witness mentioned in the Hadith.
 Documentary credits
The basis for the permissibility of charging fees for a documentary credit
is that issuing a documentary credit is a service performed in the interest of
the applicant for the documentary credit, for which the Bank has the right
to charge fees.

Shariah Standard No. (5): Guarantees
 Use of cheques or promissory notes
The Shariah basis for obtaining cheques or promissory notes from the
debtor as a guarantee is the general sources on the permissibility of guar-
antees in general.
 Insurance for debts
Islamic  insurance  is  based  on  the  principle  of  donation,  and  Gharar
is tolerable in such conditions. In Islamic insurance, the instalments that
are paid are provided within a framework of donations organised for the
mutual benefit of the contributors to the insurance fund. The permissibility
of Islamic insurance is confirmed by the resolutions issued by the Islamic
(15) and the International Islamic
Fiqh Academy of the World Muslim League (15)
and the International Islamic
Fiqh Academy of the World Muslim League
(16) Although this
Fiqh Academy of the Organisation of Islamic Conference.(16)
Fiqh Academy of the Organisation of Islamic Conference.
 Although this
form of insurance falls within the meaning of a guarantee, the guarantee
here is not provided in return for conditional consideration as such, hence
the  permissibility  of  subscribing  to  an  Islamic  insurance  coverage  as
security for doubtful or bad debts.
 Freezing cash deposits
The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a right to freeze acustomers
investment account is the permissibility of pledging funds, in addition to the
fact that the purpose behind such freezing is to be able to agree on a set-off
if it appears that the pledgor of the balance is in debt to the bank. It is a form
of mortgage to secure a possible future debt. The basis for the prohibition of
stipulating a right to freeze a customers current account is that such a right
would be tantamount to a combination of a sale on deferred payment terms and
a loan transaction; i.e., it amounts to a deferred sale with a condition to
provide a loan, which is prohibited by Shariah.
 Third party guarantees
The basis for third party guarantees is that they are a promise to volunteer

 A resolution passed by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy
states as follows:
  There is no Shariah objection to mention in the prospectus of the issue
or  in  the  documents  of  Muqaradah  (Mudarabah)  bonds  the  promise  of
a  third  party,  who  is  independent  personally  and  in  terms  of  financial
liability  from  the  two  parties  to  the  contract,  to  volunteer  an  amount
of  money  for  no  consideration  to  be  allocated  to  make  good  a  loss  on
a particular project. However, this is circumscribed with a condition that
such a promise should be an obligation independent from the Mudarabah
contract. In other words, the third partys performance of his obligation
should  not  be  a  condition  for  the  enforcement  of  the  contract  and  the
conditions and liabilities of the parties to the contract. As such, holders of
the bonds or the manager of the Mudarabah are not entitled to claim that
they may fail to honour their obligations relating to their contracts because
the volunteer failed to fulfil his promise because the performance of their

 Priority right of recovery and the right to follow up
The basis for the permissibility of the priority of certain rights, such as
those of liquidators, is that these rights are considerations that are determined
by the judiciary on the basis of public interest.  The basis for giving priority
to  a  person  whose  assets  per  se  have  contributed  to  the  increase  of  the
bankrupts assets, and have been located and identified, is the Hadith of the
Prophet (peace be upon him):

 A resolution in connection with the
permissibility of preference was issued by the Second Fiqh Seminar hosted
by Kuwait Finance House, based on a number of Fiqh rulings determining
certain preferences that include priority in the recovery of debts. The right
of following up the subject of a mortgage is based on the fact that the aim of
the mortgage is to facilitate recovery of the amount of the debt and leaving
the debtor without a right of follow-up will defeat this objective.

Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers fundamental mechanisms for converting a conven-
tional bank to a bank that complies with Shariah rules and principles right
after the decision to undertake immediate comprehensive conversion within
a particular designated period that is announced, whether such a decision
comes from within the bank or from outside the bank to be converted by
outside  parties  interested  in  converting  it.  The  standard  covers  the  time
frame required for the conversion, the effect of conversion on the methods
used to solicit and receive deposits, and the method to be used to invest
such deposits. The standard provides guidance on how to treat the receiv-
ables and liabilities realized by the bank prior to the conversion, whether
or not such receivables and liabilities are received or paid. The standard
includes a treatment of the prohibited assets that are in the possession of
the bank before conversion and the appropriate ways of disposing of them.
  The standard does not cover activities of the converting bank that are
naturally permissible or the profit made by permissible means, as these
are not the subject matter of the conversion. This is because there is no
Shariah objection to the bank continuing such activities or employing
them for its own benefit. The standard also does not cover activities of
Islamic windows or departments or units in conventional banks.
2. Time Frame for the Conversion
2/1  It  is  necessary  that  all  Shariah  requirements  be  executed  in  the
process  of  converting  a  conventional  bank  to  a  potential  Islamic
bank. It is also necessary that the Shariah rules and principles be
observed  in  respect  of  all  new  transactions  after  conversion.  In
principle,  the  transactions  that  are  concluded  before  the  decision
to  convert  must  be  ceased  or  disposed  of  immediately.  It  is  not
permissible  to  delay  clearing  out  non-permissible  transactions
152152
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
unless  such  delay  becomes  a  necessity  or
a  pressing  need.  Thus,
unless  such  delay  becomes  a  necessity  or  a  pressing  need.  Thus,
the circumstances surrounding the conversion must be taken into
consideration in order to avoid the risk of failure or a breakdown of
the banks operations, taking into account that the provisions of this
standard will be applied to accommodate the situation.
2/2  If  the  bank  did  not  decide  on  an  immediate  and  comprehensive
conversion as per item 2/1 and decided to adopt a gradual or partial
conversion,  then  it  is  not  regarded  as  a  converted  bank  and  may
not be granted a licence as an Islamic bank unless the conversion
process  is  completed.  The  shareholders  are  required  to  accelerate
the process of conversion in order to free themselves from the sin of
impermissible activities. This standard may be used as a guideline
for identifying the steps of conversion.
2/3  The impermissible profits realised and transactions concluded during
the period of conversion can be treated as per the explanation in items
8-11.
3. Necessary Measures for Conversion
3/1  For the success of the process of conversion, it is necessary that the
bank set up all necessary procedures, create the required tools, explore
alternatives  to  non-permissible  financial  practices,  and  train  and
promote  the  personnel  required  for  proper  implementation  of  the
procedures of conversion.
3/2  The  appropriate  administrative  arrangements  must  be  in  place,  in-
cluding changing the banks operating license if required by the super-
visory authorities, and amending the banks by-laws (memorandum
and articles of association) through the required procedures so that
they include objectives and operational measures that are appropriate
to Islamic banking. The by-laws must be cleansed from anything that
contradicts the nature of Islamic banking.
3/3  Restructuring the organizational structure of the bank and its em-
ployment procedures, conditions and employee statutes to fit the
situation of conversion.
153153
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
3/4  Formation  of  a  Shariah  supervisory  board  and  an  internal  Shariah
compliance department in accordance with the Governance Standards
issued by Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial
Institutions.
3/5  Reformatting or designing standard contracts or specimens or exem-
plars of documents that comply with Shariah rules and principles.
3/6  Opening  accounts  with  local  or  international  Islamic  banks  and
revamping of the accounts that are maintained with local or corre-
sponding  conventional  banks  [see,  item  4  (b)].  Any  dealings  with
conventional banks must be limited to the magnitude of the need to
do so.
3/7  Preparing a special programme for preparing personnel and training
them to deal with the application of Islamic banking practices.
3/8 Taking necessary measures for the implementation of accounting,
auditing, governance, and ethics standards issued by Accounting
and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions.
4. Dealings with Banks
4/1  Exerting all possible efforts to adapt the ways of dealing with central
banks regarding deposits, liquidity needs or otherwise in a way that
does  not  conflict  with  the  rules  of  Shariah,  especially  rules  that
govern  Riba  transactions.  The  possible  alternatives  to  the  reserve
amount required by law include, among others, depositing receivables
amount
required by law include, among others, depositing receivables
instead
represented by commercial paper to be paid later by customers instead
represented by commercial paper to be paid later by customers
of  accepting  the  freezing  of  the  cash  account.  The  bank  can  also
finance  government  projects  using  Islamic  instruments.  Among
the possible alternatives for the purpose of set-off is for the bank to
maintain  current  accounts  that  accrue  no  interest  or  disposing  of
the interest earned, if that is impossible, and adapting the ways of
dealing with the central bank for acquiring liquidity, for example, by
the opening of investment accounts for the central bank.
4/2  Revamping the transactions with conventional banks on the basis of
Riba free transactions and the application of instruments acceptable
by Shariah.
154154
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
4/3  Intensifying transactions with Islamic financial Institutions through
bilateral exchange of current or investment accounts and considerable
cooperation  in  the  areas  of  remittances,  documentary  credits  and
syndicated financing.
5. Providing Banking Services in Permissible Ways
In providing banking services, it is not permissible for the bank to receive
interest as compensation for services rendered. It is a requirement that
an  Islamic  alternative  be  worked  out,  such  as  treatment  of  uncovered
documentary credits through Murabahah, Musharakah or Mudarabah
in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  Shariah.  It  is  not  permissible  to  take
a  commission  for  providing  a  mere  facility.  However,  the  commission
may be linked to expenses incurred for the execution of the credit facility
accordingly.
6. Effect  of  Conversion  on  the  Interest  Based  Receivables  and  Their
Shariah Alternatives
6/1  All  traces  of  conventional  transactions  whereby  the  bank  originated
monetary assets and is liable to pay interest for them must be liquidated.
This is the rule whether such transactions involve individuals, banks or
central banks. This liquidation includes, among others, the conditions
relating to the deposits, preference shares, investment bonds and
interest-based  certificates  that  were  issued  by  the  bank  before  the
decision for conversion. [see item 9]
6/2  The bank must confine itself to permissible operations for acquiring
the necessary funds to operate or to meet its liabilities. Examples of
such operations are:
6/2/1 The shareholders may increase their share capital in order to
increase the banks capital and provide a basis for attracting
investment accounts and current accounts.
6/2/2  Issuance of Islamic certificates such as Mudarabah, Musharakah
or Ijarah certificates within the parameters of Shariah.
6/2/3 Concluding  Salam  contracts  whereby  the  bank  acts  in  the
capacity of a supplier, or Istisnaa contracts whereby the bank
155155
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
acts  in  the  capacity  of  a  manufacturer  or  builder  with  the
condition that the contract price of the Istisnaa is paid to the
bank in advance, although the deferment of payment of the
price in Istisnaa is allowed by Shariah.
6/2/4 Concluding a sale-and leaseback deal by selling some of the
assets  of  the  bank  for  liquidity  and  leasing  them  back  by
means of an Ijarah contract. This transaction must take into
account the Shariah Standards on Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia
Bittamleek whereby the contract of sale must be independent
from the contract of lease, i.e. the two contracts must remain
separate from each other.
6/2/5 Concluding Tawarruq deals in line with Shariah principles by
buying a commodity on a deferred payment basis and selling
it to a third party, other than the previous seller, for immediate
payment.
6/3  If  the  capital  of  the  bank  has  increased  due  to  non-permissible
transactions or the accumulation of reserves based on non-permissible
transactions,  then  its  treatment  must  be  in  accordance  with  the
treatment of non-permissible receivables or other non-permissible
assets in the possession of the bank as discussed below. [see items 8
and 10]
7. Effect of Conversion on Investments
7/1 All interest-based investment instruments must cease to be used
and must be replaced by permissible investment instruments such
as  Mudarabah,  all  Shariah-nominate  partnerships,  diminishing
Musharakah,  sharecropping  partnerships  (agricultural,  planting
or  irrigation  partnership)  or  financing  by  way  of  deferred  sales,
Murabahah,  Salam,  Istisnaa,  operating  Ijarah,  Ijarah  Muntahia
Bittamleek or other permissible financing and investment instru-
ments.ments.
7/2  All possible efforts must be exerted to terminate all interest-based loans
that the bank has made before the decision to convert, whether such
loans are medium-term or long-term facilities, followed by converting
156156
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
the  principal  amounts  to  financing  instruments  in  accordance  with
the rules and principles of Shariah. If the bank is unable to terminate
some of these loans, then the bank must dispose of the interest earned
in the manner explained in item 10/2.
8. Treatment of the Banks Non-Permissible Existing Receivables before
the Decision to Convert
8/1  Non-permissible assets of the bank originated or acquired before the
decision to convert
  Starting  from  the  financial  period  in  which  the  bank  decides  to
convert, the following must be done:
8/1/1 If a conventional bank is acquired with the intention to convert
it to an Islamic bank, the new owners are not obliged to dispose
of  interest  and  impermissible  earnings  that  have  been  earned
before such acquisition.
8/1/2 If a conventional bank is converted by its existing shareholders
into an Islamic bank, then the process of disposing of interest and
impermissible earnings should be considered as commencing
at the beginning of the financial period in which the conversion
starts to take effect. However, for any impermissible earnings
that have been distributed prior to conversion, it is necessary,
on  ethical  grounds,  for  the  shareholders  and  depositors  to
whom these earnings have been distributed to dispose of them
personally. The bank is not bound to do so.
8/1/3 Revenues  not  yet  received  that  are  of  doubtful  permissibility
are  not  subject  to  compulsory  disposal,  whether  they  were
earned before or during the financial period in which the bank
decides
to convert. The same rule applies to revenues of doubtful
decides to convert. The same rule applies to revenues of doubtful
permissibility that have been already received because of a belief
that they are permissible on the basis of (I) an interpretation of
a person who is qualified to perform
 on issues that are
Ijtihad on issues that are
a person who is qualified to perform Ijtihad
subject to personal juristic interpretation, (II) juristic position
of  an  authoritative  school  of  Shariah  or  (III)  the  opinion  of
some eminent and knowledgeable scholars.
157157
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
8/1/4 If  the  bank  has  rights  to  prohibited  non-monetary  assets,  it
may receive them with the intent to destroy them. If the bank is
entitled to receive consideration for supplying non-permissible
assets or services, the bank may receive the consideration with
the intent to donate it to charity. The same rule applies to any
income  that  has  been  acquired  from  non-permissible  assets
during  the  period  in  which  the  bank  decides  to  convert.  In
both cases, the customer should not be allowed to avoid paying
the  amount  receivable  or  the  consideration,  otherwise  such
a customer would end up being entitled to two counter-values
of the same transaction: the good or service supplied and the
price payable for it.
8/1/5 If the bank is converted and it has, among its tangible assets,
impermissible  commodities,  the  bank  is  obliged  to  destroy
them. If the bank has sold some of these commodities and is
yet to receive the price thereof, the price must be received and
be donated to charity.
8/1/6 If the property assets of the bank are locations designated for
non-permissible activities, they should be changed to locations
designated for permissible operations and services.
9. Treatment of Non-Permissible Liabilities before the Decision to Con-
vert, Whether the Conversion Is Internal or External
9/1  Internal conversion
9/1/1 If the liabilities are in the form of payment of interest, the bank
should employ all lawful means to avoid paying such interest.
This rule does not apply to the principal amounts of debts or
loans. The bank should not pay interest except on the basis of
dire need.
9/1/2  If the liabilities are in the form of obligations to provide non-
permissible services, then the bank is obliged to make every effort
to  terminate  such  liabilities,  by  refunding  the  consideration,
even  if  it  has  to  pay  compensation  for  non-fulfilment  of  such
obligations.
158158
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
9/2 External conversion through acquisition of the bank by parties
interested in converting it.
If the purchaser is capable of negotiating a deal that could exclude all
non-permissible receivables (e.g. interest and non-permissible assets)
from  the  acquisition  deal  in  a  way  that  will  make  the  seller  solely
liable  for  non-permissible  liabilities,  then  the  Shariah  requires  that
the purchaser do so. However, if the acquisition cannot be concluded
unless all assets of the bank including the non-permissible assets and
receivables are acquired, then the purchaser is required by Shariah to
act as quickly as possible to dispose of non-permissible liabilities even
if the purchaser has to suggest to the creditors of the bank an earlier
repayment for a discount.
9/3  Treatments for impermissible mortgages
  The shareholders must accelerate the redemption of all impermissible
mortgages attached to the assets of the bank. In the case of external
conversion, the buyer must stipulate that the seller replaces impermis-
sible mortgages with permissible ones.
10. Disposal of Impermissible Earnings
10/1  All impermissible earnings acquired by the bank before conver-
sion that need to be disposed of as per the rules in this standard
must without delay be paid to charity, unless it is difficult to do
so, for example, where complete disposal promptly will lead to the
collapse of the bank or bankruptcy. In this case, the implementa-
tion of conversion can reasonably take place gradually.
10/2  Any interest and other non-permissible earnings should be chan-
nelled to charity and general public utilities. It is not permissible
for the bank to use this money, directly or indirectly, for its own
benefit. Examples of charitable channels include, among others,
training people other than the staff of the bank, funding research,
providing  relief  equipment,  financial  and  technical  assistance
for Islamic countries or Islamic scientific, academic Institutions,
Islamic knowledge, and
schools, anything to do with spreading  Islamic knowledge, and
schools, anything to do with spreading
159159
Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
similar channels. The charity money must go to these channels
in  accordance  with  the  resolutions  of  the  Shariah  Supervisory
Board of the bank.
11. Zakah Obligation on the Bank before the Decision to Convert
  When  the  conversion  is  initiated  by  outsiders  who  acquired  the
conventional  bank  for  the  purpose  of  converting  it,  then  they  are
not  obliged  to  make  Zakah  payment  for  the  past  financial  periods
because the Zakah for previous periods is the liability of the previous
owners. The Zakah liability will start to exist for the new owners from
the  date  of  the  decision  to  convert.  For  the  purpose  of  discharging
the  responsibility  to  pay  Zakah,  the  owners  may  apply  the  Shariah
Standard No. (35) on Zakah. However, if the decision to convert was
made by the shareholders and the Zakah was not paid for the previous
financial periods, the shareholders are obliged to pay Zakah for these
periods. They must take into account that they are obliged to pay Zakah
even if the revenues and the money earned are impermissible because
the shareholders are obliged in the first place to dispose of all accrued
interest and impermissible earnings. So, the payment of Zakah is part
of the obligation to dispose of impermissible earnings and interest.

Brief History of
 the Preparation of the Standard
In its meeting No. (5) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 8-12 Ramadan
1421 A.H., corresponding to 4-8 December 2000 A.D., the Shariah Board
decided  to  give  priority  to  the  preparation  of  a  Shariah  Standard  on
Conversion of a Conventional bank to an Islamic Bank.
On  Monday  29  Ramadan  1421  A.H.,  corresponding  to  25  December
2000  A.D.,  a  Shariah  consultant  was  commissioned  to  prepare  a  juristic
study and an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 15-16 Safar 1422 A.H., corresponding
to 9-10 May 2001 A.D., the Shariah Studies Committee discussed the juristic
study  and  made  certain  amendments  to  it.  The  committee  also  discussed
the exposure draft of the Standard in its meeting No. (10) held in Bahrain
on 14 Rabi I, 1422 A.H., corresponding to 6 June 2001 A.D., and asked the
consultant to make some amendments in light of the comments made by the
members.

corresponding  to  5  September  2001  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Studies  Committee
discussed the exposure draft and made some relevant amendments.
The  revised  exposure  draft  of  the  standard  was  presented  to  the
Shariah Board in its meeting No. (7) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on
9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H., corresponding to 24-28 November 2001 A.D.
The  Shariah  Board  made  further  amendments  to  the  exposure  draft  of
the standard and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and
interested parties in order to obtain their comments and discuss them in
a public hearing.

Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
A  public  hearing  was  held  in  Bahrain  on  29  20  Dhul-Hajjah  1422
A.H., corresponding to 2-3 February 2002 A.D.. The public hearing was
attended  by  more  than  30  participants  representing  central  Institutions,
Institutions,  accounting  firms,  Shariah  scholars,  academics  and  others
who  are  interested  in  this  field.  The  members  responded  to  the  written
comments that were sent prior to the public hearing as well as to the oral
comments that were expressed in the public hearing.
The Shariah Standards Committee in its meeting held on 21-22 Dhul-
Hajjah1422 A.H., corresponding to 6-7 March 2002 A.D., in the Kingdom
of Bahrain discussed the comments made about the exposure draft. The
Committee made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary
in light of both the discussions that took place in the public hearing, and
the written comments that were received.
The  Shariah  Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (8)  held  on  28  Safar    4  Rabi
I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D, in Al-Madinah Al-
Munawwarah discussed the amendments made by the Shariah Standards
Committee, and made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary.
Some  paragraphs  of  the  standard  were  adopted  by  the  unanimous  vote
of  the  members  of  the  Shariah  Board,  while  the  other  paragraphs  were
adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded in the minutes
of the Shariah Board.

Shariah Standard No. (6): Conversion of a Conventional Bank to an Islamic Bank
Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Gradual Clearance of Non-Permissible Previous Transactions
The basis for the permissibility of gradual clearance of non-permissible
previous transactions due to necessity or need and in accordance with the
rules of Shariah is because it is not feasible for the converting bank to clear
all  non-permissible  transactions  immediately.  Therefore,  the  bank  must
dispose of the effects of impermissible transactions because this is feasible.
Necessary Procedures and Mechanisms for Conversion
Since the realisation of the conversion is dependent on the procedures and
mechanisms mentioned in this standard, these procedures and mechanisms
thus  become  permissible  or  in  certain  circumstances  their  use  becomes
obligatory when the conversion will not be realised without applying these
procedures and mechanisms. This is because conversion is obligatory, and if
an obligation can be realised only by means of a particular way or tool, then
the use of such a tool also becomes an obligation.
Providing Banking Services
The basis for the permissibility of providing banking services that are not
related to giving loans on an interest-bearing basis is that such an operation
is a practical application of Ijarah and an agency contract with remuneration.
If  providing  these  services  involves  Riba  then  the  operation  becomes
impermissible as it is a Riba-based transaction that is prohibited by Shariah.
Attracting Investments
The conversion necessitates doing away with the conventional methods of
attracting investment funds such as interest-bearing deposits, which should
be replaced by the application of Mudarabah and Musharakah contracts or
acting  as  an  investment  agent.  The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  using
conventional  methods  of  attracting  investments  is  the  Saying  of  Allah,

 Also, a number of Shariah boards have issued resolutions for the
treatment  of  pre-conversion  liabilities  that  involve  payment  of  interest  by
using Shariah acceptable instruments and the conversion of interest-based
bonds  to  Islamic  certificates  and  shares.(4)(4)  The  Fiqh  Academy  under  the

  The  Fiqh  Academy  under  the
auspices of the Muslim World League has issued a resolution confirming the
permissibility of Tawarruq (which is one of the instruments that can be used
to acquire liquidity).(5)(5)
to acquire liquidity).
Investment of Funds
  The basis for the rule that the bank must cease investing through making
The basis for the rule that the bank must cease investing through making
loans and receiving interest is that this is Riba and paying or receiving

ally to dispose of any dividends from non-permissible earnings that

remains  even  after  termination  of  the  responsibility  of  the  manage-

  The  basis  for  destroying  the  banks  non-permissible  tangible  assets
in the possession of others before the year of conversion is that these
assets are worthless by Shariah Standards since they are impermissible.
This is because disposing of a prohibited thing is an obligation as in
the  case  when  the  verse  that  prohibited  liquor  was  revealed  people
discharged the wine that was in their possession.

through  conversion  necessitates  refraining  from  prohibited  acts  in-
cluding payment of interest. The principle of necessity is the basis for
allowing payment of interest if the bank could not refrain from doing

so because of lack of legal protection and the possibility that the bank
may be subject to punishment that may prevent the avoidance of pay-

The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  outside  buyer  interested  in
converting  the  conventional  bank  should  exert  all  possible  effort  to
exclude  impermissible  rights  is  that  the  payment  of  interest  is  the
responsibility of the seller. Such interest would have no bearing on the
buyer of the bank as the sellers right to receive such interest can be
taken into account in computing the price to be paid for the bank. If
the buyer is unable to convince the seller in this respect, the principle
of  necessity  becomes  applicable  with  regard  to  payment  of  interest.
The basis for extinguishing Riba-based loans as soon as possible even
if  such  an  act  will  impose  on  the  buyer  the  need  to  suggest  to  the
creditor/s early payment of these loans for a discount is the principle of

  The basis for requiring that the purchaser accelerate the redemption of
The basis for requiring that the purchaser accelerate the redemption of
all impermissible mortgages attached to the assets of the bank is because
Riba is prohibited; hence, securing payment of Riba by personal guar-
antees or mortgages is also prohibited. It must be noted that the grave-
ness of securing Riba by personal guarantee is greater than graveness of
securing Riba by writing and attestation, which were mentioned in the
saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him):

witnesses.
 Treatment of Impermissible Tangible Assets Acquired by the Bank Before
the Decision to Convert
  The basis for destroying the existing tangible assets of the bank after
The basis for destroying the existing tangible assets of the bank after
conversion has already been explained. The basis for donating to char-
ity  receivables  earned  from  trading  in  such  assets  has  also  been  ex-
plained earlier. The basis for transforming the locations that were used
for impermissible services to locations for permissible services is that
the prohibition does not concern the location itself, rather the prohibi-
tion relates to the use of the location.
Disposal of Impermissible Rights
The basis for the requirement that impermissible earnings be donated
  The basis for the requirement that impermissible earnings be donated
to charity is that these revenues are not permissible for the person who
earns them. This is evidenced by the order of the Prophet (peace be
(14)
upon him) that the usurped goat be given to war prisoners.(14)

The  basis  for  indicating  charity  as  a  way  of  disposing  of  impermissi-
ble earnings is that by transferring the ownership of these earnings, the
characterisation of prohibition in respect to these earnings is changed
and they become permissible for the beneficiary. Again, a thing which
is  prohibited  for  one  person  is  not  necessarily  prohibited  for  another
person, i.e. when it is prohibited for one, it may be permissible for other.

from the earnings that must be disposed of. This is because such benefit

Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers Hawalah transactions that involve a change of debtor,
i.e. transfer of debt. The scope of this standard does not cover banking
remittances except the remittances that take the form of Hawalah (transfer
of debt).
2. Definition of Hawalah
  Hawalah of debt is the transfer of debt from the transferor (Muheel
  Hawalah of debt is the transfer of debt from the transferor (
) to the
Muheel) to the
payer (
). The transfer of right, on the other hand, is a replacement
Muhal Alaihi). The transfer of right, on the other hand, is a replacement
payer (Muhal Alaihi
of a creditor with another creditor. The transfer of debt differ from transfer
of right in that in transfer of debt a debtor is replaced by another debtor,
whereas in a transfer of right a creditor is replaced by another creditor.
3. Permissibility of Hawalah
3/1 Hawalah is a legitimate and an independent contract made out of
courtesy and is not a contract of sale. It is permitted in order to
facilitate payments and recovery.
3/2  The acceptance of Hawalah is recommended for the transferee if the
potential payer is known to be solvent and a person who honours
payments. This is because Hawalah benefits the creditor and gives
relief  to  the  debtor.  If  the  financial  status  and  creditworthiness  of
the  potential  payer  are  unknown,  then  Hawalah  becomes  MubahMubah
the  potential  payer  are  unknown,  then  Hawalah  becomes
(permissible).
4. Form of a Hawalah Contract
4/1  A contract of Hawalah can be concluded by an offer from the transferor
and acceptance from the transferee (MuhalMuhal) and the payer in a manner
and acceptance from the transferee (
) and the payer in a manner
to conclude a Hawalah
that clearly indicates the intention of the parties to conclude a Hawalah
that clearly indicates the intention of the parties
contract  and  the  transfer  of  the  liability  or  obligation  in  respect  of
176176
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
a debt from one party to another party. It is not necessary that the word
transfer be used.
4/2  Hawalah is a binding contract. Therefore, it is not subject to unilateral
termination.
4/3  It is a requirement that a transfer of debt take effect immediately,
not to be suspended for a period of time and not to be concluded
on a temporary basis or contingent on future events. However, it is
permissible to defer payment of the transferred debt until a future
specified date.
5. Types of Hawalah and the Applicable Rulings
5/1  Hawalah is divided into restricted and unrestricted Hawalah.
5/1/1 Restricted Hawalah is permissible. It is a transaction where the
payer is restricted to settling the amount of the transferred debt
from the amount of a financial or tangible asset that belongs to
the transferor and is in the possession of the payer.
5/1/2 Unrestricted Hawalah is permissible. It is a kind of transfer
of debt in which the transferor is not a creditor to the payer
and the payer undertakes to pay the amount of the debt owed
by the transferor from his own funds and to have recourse
afterwards to the transferor for settlement, provided that the
transfer for payment was made on the order of the transferor.
5/1/3 It is permitted to conclude a Hawalah on a spot payment basis.
This is a Hawalah in which the debt transferred to the payer
becomes  payable  on  the  spot,  whether  the  debt  has  already
fallen due and the obligation is then transferred to the payer for
immediate settlement, or the transferred debt is yet to fall due
and  the  transferee  has  required,  as  a  condition  for  accepting
the transfer, that it be paid immediately by virtue of transfer.
5/1/4 It is permissible to conclude a Hawalah contract on a deferred
payment basis. This is a Hawalah in which the debt transferred
payment of
to the payer is to be paid in the future, whether the payment of
to the payer is to be paid in the future, whether the
the debt is not yet due and was transferred as such to the payer,
177177
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
or the payment of such debt is due but the payer required that
it should be transferred for future payment at an agreed date.
In the latter case, the payer cannot be asked for payment before
the agreed date.
6. Conditions of Hawalah
6/1  The  permissibility  of  Hawalah  requires  the  consent  of  all  parties,
namely the transferor, the transferee and the payer.
6/2  The permissibility of a Hawalah requires that the transferor be a debt-
or to the transferee. A transaction in which a non-debtor transfers an-
other is an agency contract for collection of the debt and not a transfer
of debt.
6/3  It is not a condition in a Hawalah that the payer be a debtor to the
transferor. If the payer is not a debtor to the transferor, the Hawalah
will be an unrestricted Hawalah. [see item 5/1/2]
6/4  It is a condition that all Hawalah parties be legally competent to act
independently.
6/5  It  is  a  condition  in  Hawalah  that  both  the  transferred  debt  and  the
6/5  It is a condition in Hawalah that both the transferred debt and the
debt to be used for settlement be known and transferable.
6/6  It is a condition for concluding restricted Hawalah that the transferred
debt or the transferred portion of the debt be equal to the debt owed to
the transferee in terms of kind, type, quality and amount. However, the
transferor may transfer a lesser amount of a debt owed to the transferee
to be settled from a larger amount owed by the transferor on condition
that  the  transferee  be  entitled  only  to  the  equivalent  amount  of  his
debt.
7. Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship between the Transferor and the
Transferee
7/1  A valid Hawalah discharges the transferor from both the debt liability
and any claims in respect of it. In other words, the transferee will have
no right of recourse against the transferor for payment. However, if
178178
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
the  acceptance  of  the  transfer  was  based  on  the  condition  that  the
payer must be solvent, then the transferee will have a right of recourse
if the payer is not solvent.
7/2  The  transferee  is  entitled  to  have  a  right  of  recourse  against  the
transferor in situations of (I) death of the payer in bankruptcy, (II)
liquidation of an Institution that is the payer in the case of bankruptcy
before  payment  of  the  debt,  (III)  the  payer  is  declared  bankrupt
in his lifetime, or he denies concluding the Hawalah contract and
has taken a judicial oath to this effect and there is no evidence to
prove otherwise and (IV) the Institution that is the payer is declared
bankrupt by a court order.
8. Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship between the Transferor and the
Payer
  After the conclusion of a restricted Hawalah, the transferor is no longer
entitled to reclaim from the payer an amount transferred to the payer in
respect of the debt to be settled, because the right to receive this amount
has now passed to the transferee.
9. Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship between the Transferee and the
Payer
9/1  The transferee is entitled to claim the amount of the debt assigned to
him through Hawalah from the payer in accordance with conditions
of Hawalah contract. The payer, on the other hand, is obliged to pay
him and has no right to refuse payment.
9/2  The payer takes the place of the transferor in respect to all rights, legal
protections and obligations. The transferee in restricted Hawalah takes
the place of the transferor in respect to all rights, legal protections and
obligations against the payer.
10.  Effect of Death and Bankruptcy on a Hawalah Transaction
10/1  A Hawalah shall not be annulled by the death of the transferor or
liquidation of a transferor Institution. The transferee is the sole
owner of the amount of the debt payable by the payer and, after
179179
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
a  Hawalah  transaction,  such  a  debt  cannot  be  included  in  the
assets of the transferor that are available to be distributed, after
death or liquidation, among creditors on a pro rata basis.
10/2  A Hawalah transaction shall not be annulled due to the death of
the payer or the liquidation of the Institution acting as payer. In
these cases, the transferee will have the right of recourse against
the estate of the payer for recovery, a personal guarantor, if any,
or  pre-distribution  assets  of  the  liquidation.  However,  if  the
payer dies in the state of bankruptcy, then the transferee shall be
entitled to have recourse to the transferor. [see item 7/2]
10/3  A  Hawalah  transaction  shall  not  be  annulled  due  to  the  death
of the transferee and the heirs shall replace the transferee. The
Hawalah will also not be void in case of liquidation of a transferee
Institution  in  which  case  the  liquidator  takes  the  place  of  the
Institution for settlement.
11.  Termination of a Hawalah Liability
  A Hawalah liability will come to an end by settlement of the debt or by
a mutual agreement to terminate it or by the debt being written-off by
the transferee.
12.  Modern Applications of Hawalah Rules
12/1 Withdrawals from a current account
  An  issuance  of  a  cheque  against  a  current  account  is  a  form  of
Hawalah if the beneficiary is a creditor of the issuer or the account
holder  for  the  amount  of  the  cheque,  in  which  case  the  issuer,
the  bank  and  the  beneficiary  are  the  transferor,  the  payer  and
the transferee respectively. If the beneficiary is not a creditor to
the issuer of the cheque, then this is not a Hawalah transaction
because there can be no Hawalah transaction without an existing
debt. In the absence of a debt, the transaction becomes an agency
contract for recovery of the amount of the debt on behalf of the
transferor, which is permissible by Shariah.
180180
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
12/2  Overdrawing from an account or overdraft
If the beneficiary of the amount of a cheque is a creditor to the
issuer,  then  issuing  a  cheque  against  the  account  of  the  issuer
without  a  balance  is  unrestricted  transfer  of  debt  if  the  bank
accepts the overdraft. If the bank rejects the overdraft, then this
is not considered a transfer of debt, in which case the potential
beneficiary may have recourse to the issuer.
12/3  Travellers cheques
  The holder of a travellers cheque, the value of which has been paid
by him to the issuing Institution, is a creditor to such an Institution.
If the holder of the travellers cheque endorses the cheque in favour
of his creditor, it becomes a transfer of debt in favour of a third
party against the issuing Institution that is a debtor to the holder
of the travellers cheque. This is a restricted transfer of debt and
the  amount  of  the  debt  is  the  value  of  the  cheque  for  which  the
Institution received payment.
12/4  Bills of exchange
12/4/1 A bill of exchange is a form of Hawalah if the beneficiary is
a creditor to the drawer. The drawer is, in this case, the
transferor  who  gives  orders  for  the  paying  bank  to  pay
a certain sum of money at a specified date to the defined
beneficiary. The party executing payment of such amount
of  money  is  the  payer  whereas  the  beneficiary,  i.e.  the
holder  of  the  bill,  is  the  transferee.  If  the  beneficiary  is
not a creditor of the drawer, then the issuance of the bill
of  exchange  becomes  an  agency  contract  to  recover  or
collect the amount of the bill of exchange on behalf of the
drawer.
12/4/2  In the absence of a debt obligation between the drawer
and the paying bank, the issuance of a bill of exchange
becomes an unrestricted Hawalah.
181181
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
12/5 Endorsement of a negotiable instrument
12/5/1  An endorsement of a negotiable instrument in a manner
that transfers title to its value to the beneficiary is a form
of Hawalah if the beneficiary is a creditor to the endorser.
If the beneficiary is not a creditor to the endorser, the en-
dorsement becomes one of agency contract for collection
of the amount of the debt.
12/5/2  An endorsement of a bill of exchange on behalf of a client
who requires the Institution to transfer, after collection,
the  amount  of  the  instrument  into  his  account  is  not
a Hawalah. This is a contract of agency that is permissible
with or without consideration.
12/5/3  Subject to item 12/5/1, it is permissible for the first beneficiary
from a bill of exchange to endorse it in favour of any other
party.  The  second  beneficiary  may  also  endorse  such  a  bill
of exchange in favour of a third party and so on, in which
of  exchange  in  favour  of  a  third  party  and  so  on,  in  which
case  the  revolving  of  endorsements  is  a  form  of  successive
Hawalah which is not objectionable in Shariah.
12/5/4  It is not permissible to discount bills of exchange by trans-
ferring the ownership of their value, before their due date,
to  an  Institution  or  others  for  a  discounted  immediate
payment. This is because the transaction in this manner is
a form of Riba.
12/6 Transfer of money (remittances)
  The request of a customer for the Institution to transfer a certain
amount of money in the same currency from his current account
to a particular beneficiary is a transfer of debt if the applicant is
a debtor to such a beneficiary. The fee that the Institution gains
from  this  transaction  is  consideration  for  the  delivery  of  the
money and it is not an additional amount gained by the Institution
over the amount transferred. However, if a remittance is to take
place in a currency different from that presented by the applicant
182182
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
for the transfer, then the transaction consists of a combination of
currency  exchange  and  a  transfer  of  money  that  is  permissible.

No. (5) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 8-12 Ramadan
1421 A.H., corresponding to 4-8 December 2000 A.D., the Shariah Board
decided to give priority to the preparation of a Shariah Standard on Hawalah.
On 29 Ramadan 1421 A.H., corresponding to 25 December 2000 A.D.,
a  Shariah  consultant  was  commissioned  to  prepare  a  juristic  study  and
an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 15-16 Safar 1422 A.H., corresponding
to  9-10  May  2001  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Studies  Committee  discussed  the
juristic  study  and  made  certain  amendments  to  it.  The  committee  also
discussed the exposure draft of the Standard in its meeting No. (10) held in
Bahrain on 14 Rabi I, 1422 A.H., corresponding to 6 June 2001 A.D., and
asked the consultant to make some amendments in light of the comments
made by the members.
In its meeting No. (11) held in Jordan on 17 Jumada II, 1422 A.H., cor-
responding to 5 September 2001 A.D., the Shariah Studies Committee dis-
cussed the exposure draft and made some relevant amendments.
The revised exposure draft of the standard was presented to the Shariah
Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (7)  held  in  Makkah  Al-Mukarramah  on  9-13
Ramadan 1422 A.H., corresponding to 24-28 November 2001 A.D. The
Shariah  Board  made  further  amendments  to  the  exposure  draft  of  the
standard  and  decided  that  it  should  be  distributed  to  specialists  and
interested parties in order to obtain their comments in order to discuss
them in a public hearing.
A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 2920 Dhul-Hajjah 1422 A.H.,
corresponding  to  2-3  February  2002.  The  public  hearing  was  attended  by
185185
Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
more  than  30  participants  representing  central  Institutions,  Institutions,
accounting firms, Shariah scholars, academics and others who are interested
in  this  field.  The  members  responded  to  the  written  comments  that  were
sent  prior  to  the  public  hearing  as  well  as  to  the  oral  comments  that  were
expressed in the public hearing.
The Shariah Standards Committee in its meeting held on 21-22 Dhul-
Hajjah 1422 A.H., corresponding to 6-7 March 2002 A.D., in the Kingdom
of Bahrain discussed the comments made about the exposure draft. The
Committee made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary
in light of both the discussions that took place in the public hearing, and
the written comments that were received.
The  Shariah  Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (8)  held  on  28  Safar    4  Rabi
I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-
Munawwarah discussed the amendments made by the Shariah Standards
Committee,  and  made  the  necessary  amendments,  which  it  deemed
necessary. Some paragraphs of the standard were adopted by the unanimous
vote of the members of the Shariah Board, while the other paragraphs were
adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded in the minutes
of the Shariah Board.
The Shariah Standards Review Committee reviewed the standard in its
meeting held in Rabi II, 1433 A.H., corresponding to March 2012 A.D.,
in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments
(additions,  deletions,  and  rephrasing)  as  deemed  necessary,  and  then
submitted the proposed amendments to the Shariah Board for approval
as it deemed necessary.
In its meeting No. (39)  held in the Kingdom of Bahrain on 13-15 Mu-
harram 1435 A.H., corresponding to 6-8 November 2014 A.D., the Shariah
Board  discussed  the  proposed  amendments  submitted  by  the  Shariah
Standards Review Committee. After deliberation, the Shariah Board ap-
proved necessary amendments, and the standard was adopted in its cur-
rent amended version.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Permissibility of Hawalah
The contract of Hawalah derives its permissibility from the Qur`an, the
Sunnah, Ijma (consensus of Fuqaha) and reasoning. Abu Hurayrah (may
Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
Default on payment by a solvent debtor is unjust, and if anyone of you
said: Default on payment by a solvent debtor is unjust, and if anyone of you
said:
is transferred to a solvent person, he must accept the transfer.(2)(2) In another
is transferred to a solvent person, he must accept the transfer.
In another
text of the Hadith, related by Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi, the Prophet (peace
If  one  is  referred  to  a  solvent  person  for  the  recovery
be  upon  him)  said:  If  one  is  referred  to  a  solvent  person  for  the  recovery
be  upon  him)  said:
of  his  right,  such  a  person  must  accept  the  transfer.
  The  Prophets  order
of  his  right,  such  a  person  must  accept  the  transfer.  The  Prophets  order
that the creditor must accept the transfer means transfer of debt is legal,
otherwise he would not give that order.
The permissibility of Hawalah has enjoyed unanimity in Muslim soci-
eties and communities from time immemorial and there is no report that
anyone has disapproved of it.(3)(3)
anyone has disapproved of it.
The acceptance of a Hawalah contract is recommended for the transferee
if  the  potential  payer  is  known  to  be  solvent  and  keeps  his  promises  in
respect to payments because it benefits the creditor and gives relief to the
debtor from liability by the transfer.

remains permissible.
A Hawalah Contract is Binding
If all its conditions are met, a Hawalah contract becomes binding without
any difference of opinion among the scholars.
Form of a Hawalah Contract
The contract of Hawalah cannot be concluded on a deferred basis or
subject to the happening of a particular event, as it has the character of
a  contract  of  (immediate)  exchange.  This  is  because  by  virtue  of  the
Hawalah  contract  both  the  transferee  (the  payee)  and  the  payer  have
immediately entered into a new contractual relationship. Also, a Hawalah
cannot be concluded on a temporary basis nor can it be contingent on
future events, because this conflicts with the nature of Hawalah which is
the immediate transfer of the debt to the payer.(4)(4)
the immediate transfer of the debt to the payer.
Types and Rulings of a Hawalah Contract
The scholars have unanimously endorsed the permissibility of restricted
  The scholars have unanimously endorsed the permissibility of restricted
Hawalah,  whether  it  is  restricted  to  a  debt  owed  to  the  transferor  by
the payer or it is restricted to the value of a tangible good belonging to
the transferor in the possession of the payer. The unrestricted Hawalah
is permitted by the Hanafis only. They based this permissibility on the
Prophets order that a Hawalah deal must be accepted, without indicating
that the payer must be a debtor to the transferor or not. This shows the
permissibility
permissibility of both the unrestricted and restricted Hawalah.
   The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  a  deferred  Hawalah  contract  is  that
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  a  deferred  Hawalah  contract  is  that
the payer is liable to make payment to the payee (transferee) by virtue of
Hawalah. This permissibility is analogous to the permissibility of a de-
ferred guarantee contract. As a matter of principle, a right that is due by
virtue of Hawalah is similar to a right that is due by virtue of a guarantee
 of both the unrestricted and restricted Hawalah.(5)(5)

 does not
Hawalat al-Haqq does not
significantly differ from restricted transfer of debt. If one looks at the
change of creditor, then the transaction is one of transfer of rights, and
if one looks at the change of debtor, it is a restricted transfer of debt. The
differences between transfer of debt and transfer of right are evident in
some forms, such as when the creditor makes a gift of the amount of
his debt claim against the payer to a person who is not a debtor to the
transferor.  Here,  there  are  not  two  debts,  hence  there  is  a  transfer  of
right and not a restricted Hawalah because of the lack of two debtors,
as the transferor here is not a creditor of the beneficiary from the gift.
Conditions of Hawalah

permissibility of the Hawalah contract.
b) The  transferee  must  also  consent  to  the  Hawalah  contract  because
the Hawalah contract necessitates a transfer of his right to payment
from  the  transferor  as  debtor  to  another  person  (the  payer),  and
people differ in various aspects when it comes to payment of debts.
c) The payer must also consent in the unrestricted Hawalah because
the effect of the Hawalah contract is to make the payer liable for
payment and, as a principle; there is no liability without there first
being an acceptance of such liability.(8)(8)

tract valid. In other words, a Hawalah contract is permissible even if the
amount of one of the two liabilities is either greater or lesser than the
other liability provided that the transferee will be paid only an amount
equivalent  to  his  debt.  For  example,  one  can  transfer  the  right  to  his
creditor to collect 10 dinars, the equivalent amount of his debt, out of
the 20 dinars he is owed. The transferor may also direct the transferee
to collect five dinars being his right against the payer out of the ten the
transferor owes the transferee. Therefore, the similarity in amount that
is required here is that the transferee must not take more than the actual
amount of his debt. The intention of this is to avoid Riba.(9)(9)
amount of his debt. The intention of this is to avoid Riba.
Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferor and the
Transferee
The reason for saying that the transferor is discharged from liability
  The reason for saying that the transferor is discharged from liability
after the conclusion of a Hawalah transaction is because this is the legal
effect of Hawalah. Hawalah means that the other party (the transferee)
is deemed to have received his right to payment by the payer outright,
which connotes its obligatory nature. Therefore, the transaction can-
not be reversed for the simple reason that if something is transferred
then it cannot be argued that it remains in the same place. This means
the transferee is not entitled to ask the transferor for payment and the
payer, on the other hand, becomes liable for payment.

The right of the transferee to have recourse, in the event of non-per-
  The right of the transferee to have recourse, in the event of non-per-
formance by the payer, to the transferor as advocated by the Hanafis is
based on a Hadith. It is reported that Uthman Ibn Affan was asked about
a situation in which a transfer of debt is concluded and the transferee

Shariah Standard No. (7): Hawalah
  The Hadith that says, Muslims are bound by the conditions they made
found the payer had died in a state of bankruptcy. The answer was that
the transferee is entitled to return to the transferor for payment, as the
right of a Muslim cannot go unfulfilled.
 This report reveals that the

transferor has a right of recourse to the original debtor if the payment is
not attained due to bankruptcy or death of the payer.
The Hadith that says, Muslims are bound by the conditions they made(12)
(12)
is the basis for the view of the majority of jurists that the transferee has
a right of recourse to the transferor if he had stipulated that he accepts
the transfer on the basis that the payer is solvent and is capable of paying
the amount of the debt. Moreover, this stipulation serves the purpose
of  the  contract;  hence,  termination  of  the  contract  takes  place  if  such

a condition is not met.(13)
a condition is not met.
The Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferor and
the Payer
The basis for the rule that the transferor loses his claim over the amount
of the debt against the payer after the Hawalah transaction is that the right to
this claim has shifted to the transferee by virtue of the contract of Hawalah.
The Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferee and
the Payer
The basis for the rule that the transferee no longer has a financial claim
against the transferor is that the contract of Hawalah transfers the liability

to pay to the payer.(14)
to pay to the payer.
The right of the payer to be entitled to all rights associated with the
securities  that  were  available  to  the  debtor  (the  transferor)  is  based  on
the fact that these securities are associated with the debt of the transfer
or, which are the subject matter of the Hawalah contract. These rights are

Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers the Murabahah transaction and its various stages,
the issues relating to guarantees before concluding a Murabahah deal such
as  promise,
  (security  deposit)  and  issues  relating  to
Hamish  Jiddiyyah  (security  deposit)  and  issues  relating  to
as  promise,  Hamish  Jiddiyyah
guarantees for recovery of the debt created by the Murabahah transaction.
  This standard does not cover deferred payment sales that take place on
a basis other than that of Murabahah. It also does not cover other trust
and bargaining sales.
2. Procedures Prior to the Contract of Murabahah
2/1  The customers expression of his wish to acquire an item through
the Institution
2/1/1 The  Institution  may  purchase  the  item  only  in  response  to
its customers wish and application, as long as this practice is
compatible with the Shariah precepts for the contract of sale.
2/1/2 With due consideration to item 2/2/3, it is permissible for the
customer to request the Institution to purchase the item from
a particular source of supply. However, the Institution is entitled
to decline to carry out the transaction if the customer refuses
offers from other sources of supply that are more suitable for
the Institution.
2/1/3 The  customers  wish  to  acquire  the  item  does  not  constitute
a promise or commitment except when it has been expressed
in due form. It is permissible to prepare a single set of docu-
mentation  to  be  signed  by  the  customer  and  to  include  both
the customers stated wish that the Institution should buy the
item from the supplier and a promise to buy the item from the
Institution. It is permissible for the customer to prepare suchsuch
Institution. It is permissible for the customer to prepare
200200
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
a document, or it may be a standard application form prepared
by the Institution to be signed by the customer.
2/1/4 The customer may obtain statement of prices from the supplier
whether they are addressed to the customer by name [specific
offer],  or  with  no  reference  to  any  named  customer  [general
offer]. In the latter case, the statement is considered as an in-
vitation to negotiate, and not as an offer of sale. It is preferable
that the invoice should be addressed to the Institution so as to
include an offer of sale from the supplier effective up to the end
of a specified period. The contract of sale is deemed concluded
once acceptance comes from the Institution.
2/2 The position of the Institution in respect to the application of
the customer for Murabahah
2/2/1  When there is acceptance by the customer of an offer from the
supplier that is either addressed to him personally, or that has no
addressee, then the sale is concluded with the customer and so it
is not permissible for the Institution to carry out Murabahah on
the same item.
2/2/2 It  is  essential  to  exclude  any  prior  contractual  relationship
between the customer who is the purchase orderer and the
original  supplier  of  the  item  ordered,  if  any,  regarding  the
supply  of  the  item.  It  is  a  requirement  of  Murabahah  that
the transaction between the two parties must genuinely, not
fictitiously, exclude any prior contractual relationship.
It is not permissible to assign a contract that has been executed
between the customer and the supplier of the ordered item to
the Institution.
2/2/3 The  Institution  must  ensure  that  the  party  from  whom  the
item  is  bought  is  a  third  party  other  than  customer  or  his
agent. For example, it is not permitted for a customer to sell
an ordered item to the Institution and then repurchase it through
supplying
a Murabahah transaction. Nor may the party that is supplying
a Murabahah transaction. Nor may the party that is
the item be wholly, or by way of majority [more than 50%],
201201
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
owned by the customer. If a sale transaction takes place and
later on it is discovered that it was carried out through such
practices, this would render the transaction void as it is tan-
tamount to Inah.
2/2/4 If  the  supplier  (owner)  of  the  item  has  a  blood  relationship
or marital relationship with the customer, then the Institution
shall  verify,  before  entering  into  Murabahah,  that  the  sale  is
Inah.
not fictitious and not a stratagem for the sale of Inah.
not fictitious and not a stratagem for the sale of
2/2/5  It is not permissible for the Institution and the customer to agree
to form a Musharakah in a project or a specified deal together
with  a  promise  from  one  of  them  to  buy  the  others  share  in
Musharakah by means of Murabahah on either spot or deferred
payment  terms.  However,  it  is  permissible  for  one  partner  to
promise to purchase the others share in Musharakah at market
price or at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale provided
a new contract is drawn up. This sale may be on spot or on
deferred payment terms.
2/2/6  It is not permitted to carry out a Murabahah on deferred payment
terms where the asset involved is gold, silver or currencies.
2/2/7 It is also impermissible to issue negotiable Sukuk where the
underlying asset consists of Murabahah receivables or other
receivables only.
2/2/8 Likewise, it is not permitted to renew a Murabahah contract on
the same commodity that was the subject matter of a previous
Murabahah contract with the same customer, i.e. to refinance
the transaction.
2/3  The promise from the customer
2/3/1 It is not permissible that the document of promise to purchase
(signed by the customer) should include a bilateral promise
which  is  binding  on  both  parties  (the  Institution  and  the
customer).
202202
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
2/3/2 The customers promise to purchase, and the related contrac-
tual framework, are not integral to a Murabahah transaction,
but are intended to provide assurance that the customer will
complete the transaction after the item has been acquired by
the Institution. If the Institution has other opportunities to sell
the item, then it may not need such a promise or contractual
framework.
2/3/3 A bilateral promise between the customer and the Institution
is permissible only if there is an option to cancel the promise
which may be exercised either by both promisors or by either
one of them.
2/3/4 It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution  and  the  customer,  after
the  latter  has  given  a  promise  but  before  the  execution  of
the Murabahah, to agree to revise the terms of the promise
whether with respect to the deferment of payment, the mark-
up or other terms. The terms of the promise cannot be revised
except by mutual consent by both parties.
2/3/5  It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution  to  purchase  the  item  from
a supplier on a sale or return basis, i.e., with the option to return
it within a specified period. If the customer then does not purchase
the item, the Institution is able to return it to the supplier within
the specified period on the basis of the conditional option that is
established in Shariah. The option between the Institution and the
supplier does not expire by the mere presentation of the item to the
customer, but it expires by virtue of the actual sale to the customer.
It is advisable to stipulate in a stipulated option to revoke (khiyar al-

khiyar al-
Shart
) that the mere offer by the purchaser for the sale of the item to
Shart) that the mere offer by the purchaser for the sale of the item to
a third party does not invalidate the option.
2/4  Commissions and expenses
2/4/1 It is not permissible for the Institution to receive a commitment
fee from the customer.
203203
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
2/4/2 It  is  not  permissible  for  the  Institution  to  receive  a  fee  for
providing a credit facility.
2/4/3 The  expenses  of  preparing  the  documents  of  the  contract
between the Institutions and the customer are to be borne evenly
by the two parties (the Institution and the customer), provided
they do not agree that the expenses are to be borne wholly by
one party, and provided those expenses are proportional to the
actual amount of work involved, so that they do not implicitly
include a commitment fee or a facility fee.
2/4/4 If the Murabahah is carried out by means of syndicated financ-
ing, the Institution which acts as the arranger of the syndicate
is entitled to an arrangement fee to be paid by the participants
in the syndicate.
2/4/5 It is permissible for the Institution to receive a fee for a feasibility
study that it undertakes in case such study is requested by the
customer and for the benefit thereof and the customer agrees
to pay the fee thereof. The customer is entitled to a copy of the
study if he so requires.
2/5  Guarantees related to the commencement of the transaction
2/5/1 It is permissible for the Institution to obtain from the customer
(the purchase orderer) a guarantee (performance deed) regard-
ing  the  good  performance  by  the  supplier  of  his  contractual
obligations towards the Institution in his personal capacity and
not  in  his  capacity  as  purchase  orderer  or  in  his  capacity  as
an agent of the Institution. Hence, if the Murabahah contract
is not executed, his guarantee would still be valid. This guaran-
tee is required only in cases where the customer has suggested
a  particular  source  of  supply  for  the  item  that  is  the  subject
matter of the Murabahah contract.
As  a  consequence  of  this  guarantee,  the  customer  shall  make
good  any  damage  suffered  by  the  Institution  due  to  failure  of
the  supplier  to  provide  good  performance  of  his  contractual
obligations. These obligations concern meeting the specification

of  the  item  to  be  supplied  and  the  exercise  of  diligence  in
executing the contract, non-observance of which may result in
the  loss  of  the  Institutions  time  and  efforts  or  property,  or  in
a legal dispute and damage claims.
2/5/2 It is not permitted to impose on a customer who is the purchase
orderer a guarantee regarding hazards that may affect the item
such as damage and destruction during a period of shipment
or storage.
2/5/3 It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution,  in  the  case  of  a  binding
promise  by  the  customer,  to  take  a  sum  of  money  as
Hamish
promise  by  the  customer,  to  take  a  sum  of  money  as  Hamish

namely the difference between the cost of the item borne the
Institution  and  the  price  at  which  the  item  is  sold  to  a  third
party.  The  actual  damage  to  the  Institution  may  not  include
the loss of its mark-up in the Murabahah transaction, that is,
its opportunity loss.

Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
2/5/5 When the customer has fulfilled his promise and executed the
Hamish
contract  of  Murabahah,  the  Institution  must  refund  Hamish
contract  of  Murabahah,  the  Institution  must  refund
Jiddiyyah  to  the  customer.  The  Institution  is  not  entitled  to
Jiddiyyah
  to  the  customer.  The  Institution  is  not  entitled  to
receive any amount out of

for the Institution to agree with the customer that the amount
of of Hamish Jiddiyyah
 will be deducted from the price payable
Hamish Jiddiyyah will be deducted from the price payable
by the customer pursuant to the contract of Murabahah.
2/5/6  It is permissible for the Institution to take Arboun (Earnest Mon-
ey) upon conclusion of the Murabahah sale with the customer.
This may not be done during the contractual stage at which the
customer has given his promise to purchase. In the event that the
customer revokes the contract in an Arboun-based transaction,
it  is  preferable  that  the  Institution,  after  deducting  the  actual
damage it incurs, refunds the remaining amount of Arboun to
the customer. The damage in this context means the difference
between the cost of the item borne the Institution and the price
at which the item is sold to a third party.
3. Acquisition of Title to, and Possession of, the Asset by the Institution
or Its Agent
3/1  The acquisition of the asset or good by the Institution prior to its
sale by means of Murabahah
3/1/1  The Institution shall not sell any item in a Murabahah transac-
tion before it acquires such item. Hence, it is not valid for the In-
stitution to conclude a Murabahah sale with the customer before
the  Institution  concludes  a  urchase  contract  with  the  supplier
of the item the subject matter of the Murabahah and before it
acquires actual or constructive possession of such items, which
can be achieved when the
supplier gives the Institution control
can be achieved when the supplier gives the Institution control
over the item or the documents that represent possession there-
bahah is consid-
of [see items 3/2/1-3/2/4]. Likewise, the Murabahah is consid-
of [see items 3/2/1-3/2/4]. Likewise, the Mura
ered void in case the contract with the supplier is void, because
206206
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
in this case the Institution would fail to acquire complete title to
the item.
3/1/2  It is permitted that the contract between the Institution and the
supplier be completed by means of a meeting of the two parties to
discuss the details, at which point the contract may be executed.
Likewise, it is permitted that the contract be completed through
exchanging  of  the  notices  of  offer  and  acceptance,  either  in
writing or by any form of modern communication customarily
practiced according to known principles.
3/1/3 The  original  principle  is  that  the  Institution  itself  purchases
the item directly from the supplier. However, it is permissible
for the Institution to carry out the purchase by authorizing
an  agent,  other  than  the  purchase  orderer,  to  execute  the
purchase; and the customer (the purchase orderer) should not
be appointed to act as an agent except in case of a dire
need.
be appointed to act as an agent except in case of a dire need.
Furthermore,  the  agent  must  not  sell  the  item  to  himself.
Rather, the Institution must first acquire title of the item and
then sell it to the agent. In such a case, the provisions of item
3/1/5 should be observed.
3/1/4  In cases when the customer is authorized to purchase the item
as  the  Institutions  agent,  it  is  obligatory  to  adopt  procedures
which would ensure that certain conditions are observed. These
conditions include:
a) the Institution itself must pay the supplier, and not pay the
price of the item into the account of the customer as agent,
whenever possible.
b) the Institution should obtain from the supplier the documents
that confirm that a sale has taken place.
3/1/5 It is obligatory to separate the two liabilities of risk attaching
to the purchased item, namely the liability of the Institution
and  the  liability  of  the  customer  as  agent  of  the  Institution.
This  is  achieved  by  having  an  interval  in  time  between  the
207207
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
performance  of  the  agency  contract  and  the  execution  of
the  contract  of  Murabahah,  as  indicated  in  the  customers
notice  of  performance  of  the  agency  contract  to  acquire  the
item and offer to purchase the item by means of Murabahah
[see  Appendix  (a)],  followed  by  the  institutions  notice  of
its  acceptance  of  the  customers  offer  to  purchase  and  the
execution of the Murabahah sale contract [see Appendix (b)].
3/1/6 The  original  principle  is  that  all  documents  and  contracts
concerned with the execution of the sale of the item must be
in the name of the Institution and not in that of the customer,
unless the latter acts as the Institutions agent in acquiring the
item.
3/1/7 It  is  permissible,  at  the  time  when  the  Institution  appoints
someone as its agent for the acquisition of the item, that the two
parties  agree  to  authorize  the  agent  to  carry  out  the  acquisi-
tion of the item as agent, without disclosing the existence of the
agency agreement. In this case, the agent will act as principal
in dealing with other parties, and will undertake the purchase
directly in his name but on behalf of the Institution as principal.
However, it is preferable that the agents role be disclosed.
3/2 The Institutions taking possession of the asset or good, prior to
its sale by Murabahah
3/2/1 It  is  obligatory  that  the  Institutions  actual  or  constructive
possession  of  the  item  be  ascertained  before  its  sale  to  the
customer on the basis of Murabahah.
3/2/2 The  condition  that  possession  of  the  item  must  be  taken  by
the  Institution  (before  its  onward  sale  to  the  customer)  has
a specific purpose: that the Institution must assume the risk of
the item it intends to sell. This means that the item must move
from the responsibility of the supplier to the responsibility of
the Institution. Similarly, it is obligatory that the point when the
risk of the item is passed on by the Institution to the customer
208208
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
be clearly identified, with reference to the stages in which the
item is transferred from one party to another.
3/2/3 The  forms  of  taking  delivery  or  possession  of  items  differ
according  to  their  nature  and  different  trade  customs.  Taking
possession may be actual in the case of the physical delivery or
transportation to the acquirer or its agent, but may also take place
constructively by placing of the item at the acquirers disposal
so as to enable him to deal with it at his will, even though no
physical delivery has taken place. Taking possession of an item
of real property may also take place by means of the property
being  vacated  and  its  being  placed  at  the  acquirers  disposal;
if the latter is not able to have disposal of the purchased item,
then the vacation of the property is not considered as conveying
possession. In the case of moveable assets, possession will take
place in accordance with the nature of the asset.
3/2/4  The receipt of a bill of lading by the Institution or its agent, when
purchasing  goods  on  the  international  market,  is  considered  as
constructive possession. The same would apply to the Institutions
receipt of certificates of storage issued by warehouses following
appropriate and reliable formalities.
3/2/5 The original principle is that the Institution itself must receive
the item from the premises of the supplier or from a location
that is specified in the delivery conditions. The responsibility
for the risk attached to the item is transferred to the Institution
upon its taking possession of the item. However, it is permissible
for the Institution to authorize another party to take delivery of
the item on its behalf.
3/2/6 As  the  Institution  is  the  owner  of  the  subject  matter  of
its insurance lies with the Institution before selling
Murabahah its insurance lies with the Institution before selling
Murabahah
it to the customer. Any amount recovered from insurance at
this  stage  will  belong  to  the  Institution  exclusively  and  the
customer  has  no  claim  to  it  even  if  the  recovered  amount
include
exceeds the purchase price. The Institution is entitled to include
exceeds the purchase price. The Institution is entitled to
209209
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
the expenses of insurance in the Murabahah cost price to be
subsequently  added  to  the  price  of  Murabahah.  Insurance
must be on the basis of Takaful whenever possible.
3/2/7 Agency in carrying out the procedures of obtaining insurance
cover for the item at the stage of the Institutions acquisition of
ownership of the asset is permitted. However, it is obligatory
that the Institution should bear the cost of insurance.
4. Conclusion of a Murabahah Contract
4/1  It is not permitted for the Institution to consider that the contract of
Murabahah is automatically concluded by its mere taking possession
of the asset. Likewise, the Institution may not force a customer who
is  the  purchase  orderer  to  take  delivery  of  the  asset  and  pay  the
Murabahah  selling  price,  if  the  customer  refuses  to  conclude  the
Murabahah transaction.
4/2  The Institution is entitled to receive compensation for any actual
damage it has incurred as a result of the customers breach of a binding
promise. The compensation consists of the customer reimbursing the
Institution for any loss due to a difference between the price received
by the Institution in selling the asset to a third party and the original
cost price paid by the Institution to the supplier.
4/3  When  the  Institution  has  purchased  an  asset  for  a  deferred  price,
with the intention that it will be sold on a Murabahah basis, then the
Institution is obliged to disclose to the customer that the asset is pur-
chased by the Institution on deferred payment basis. The Institution
has the obligation to disclose to the customer, when concluding the
contract of sale, the details of any expenses that it would include in
determining the cost. The Institution is also entitled to include any
expenses  relating  to  the  item  if  this  is  acceptable  to  the  customer.
However, if the Institution failed to disclose any expenses, it is not
entitled to include them unless they are customarily considered as
normal expenses, such as transportation expenses, storage expenses,
fees for letters of credit and insurance premiums.
210210
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
4/4  The Institution is not entitled to include in the base cost of the item,
for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the  Murabahah  price,  any  amounts
other than the direct expenses that are paid to a third party. It is not
permissible, for example, for the Institution to add to the cost of the
item payments made to its own staff for their work, and the like.
4/5  If the Institution has, even after the drawing up of the Murabahah
contract,  received  a  discount  for  the  same  item  that  was  sold  on
Murabahah basis from the supplier of the item, then the customer
should benefit from that discount by a reduction of the total Murabahah
selling price in proportion to the discount.
4/6  It is an obligation that both the price of the item and the Institutions
profit  on  the  Murabahah  transaction  be  fixed  and  known  to  both
parties on the signature of the contract of sale. It is not permitted
under any circumstances to subject the determination of the price or
the profit to unknown variations or variations that are determinable
in the future, such as by concluding the sale and making the profit
dependent on the rate of LIBOR that will prevail in the future. There
is no objection to referring to any other known indicators during the
promise stage as a comfort indicator to determine the rate of profit,
provided that the determination of the Institutions profit at the time
of concluding the Murabahah is based on a certain percentage of the
cost and is not tied up with LIBOR or a time factor.
4/7  The Institutions profit mark-up in Murabahah must be known, and the
mere mention of the total selling price is not sufficient. It is permissible
that the profit be determined based on a lump sum
amount or a certain
that the profit be determined based on a lump sum amount or a certain
percentage of the cost price only or of the cost price plus the expenses.
This determination is completed by the agreement and mutual consent
of the two parties.
4/8  It  is  permissible  to  agree  on  the  payment  of  the  price  of  the  item
under Murabahah either by short or long term instalments, and the
selling price of the asset becomes a debt that the customer is obligated
to pay at the time agreed upon. It is not permitted subsequently to
of  extra  time
demand  any  extra  payment  either  in  consideration  of  extra  time
demand  any  extra  payment  either  in  consideration
211211
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
given for payment or for delay in payment that may be for a reason
or no reason.
4/9  It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution  to  stipulate  in  the  contract  of
Murabahah a condition that the Institution is free from responsibility
for all or some of the defects of the asset, but not from destruction
caused  before  the  possession  of  the  customer  or  diminution  of
quantity sold; this is known as
 (sale on as is basis).
Bay al-Bara`ah (sale on as is basis).
quantity sold; this is known as Bay al-Bara`ah
In the case of stipulating such a condition, it is preferable that the
Institution should assign to the customer the right of recourse to the
supplier to obtain compensation for any defects that are established,
which would otherwise be recoverable by the Institution from the
supplier.
4/10 The Institution shall be responsible for pre-existing hidden defects
which appear after the conclusion of the contract, unless it stipulates
otherwise according to item 10/4. However, it shall not be responsible
for any new defects (recent defects) that arise after the conclusion of
the contract and taking delivery by the customer.
4/11 The Institution is entitled to include, as a condition of the contract,
that  in  case  of  the  customers  refusal,  after  the  execution  of  the
Murabahah contract, to take delivery of the asset at the prescribed
time, the Institution could revoke the contract or sell the asset to
a  third  party  on  behalf  of  the  customer  and  for  his  account.  The
Institution  could  then  recover  from  the  selling  price  the  amount
due  to  it  from  the  customer  under  the  contract,  and  would  have
recourse  to  the  customer  for  the  balance  if  that  price  were  not
sufficient to cover the amount due to the customer.
5. Guarantees and Treatment of Murabahah Receivables
5/1  It is permissible for the Institution to stipulate to the customer that
instalments may become due before their originally agreed due dates
in  case  of  the  customers  refusal  or  delay  in  paying  any  instalment
without any valid reason after the lapse of the time specified in the
notice to be sent by the Institution to the customer within a reasonable
period of time following the due date.
212212
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
5/2  The  Institution  should  ask  the  customer  to  provide  permissible
security  in  the  contract  of  Murabahah.  Among  other  things,  the
Institution may receive a third party guarantee or the mortgagee of
Institution
may receive a third party guarantee or the mortgagee of
the
investment account of the customer or the mortgagee of any item
the investment account of the customer or the mortgagee of any item
of real or moveable property, or the mortgagee of the subject matter
of the Murabahah contract as a fiduciary mortgagee (or a registered
charge), either without taking possession of the mortgageed asset,
or by taking possession of the mortgageed asset and then releasing
the mortgagee progressively according to the percentage of the total
payment received.
5/3  It is permissible for the Institution to require the customer to provide
cheques or promissory notes before the execution of the contract of
Murabahah, as a guarantee of the indebtedness that will be created
after the execution of the contract. This is possible on the written
condition that the Institution is not entitled to use these cheques or
documents except on their due dates. The requirement to provide
cheques as security is not permissible in countries where they could
be presented for payment before their due date.
5/4  It is not permissible to stipulate that the ownership of the item will
not  be  transferred  to  the  customer  until  the  full  payment  of  the
selling price. However, it is permissible to postpone the registration
of the asset in the customers name as a guarantee of the full payment
of the selling price. The Institution may receive authority from the
customer to sell the asset in case the customer delays payment of the
selling price, in which case the Institution should issue a counter-
deed to the customer to establish the latters right to ownership. If
the Institution sells the asset as a result of the customers failure to
make a payment of the selling price on its due date, it must confine
itself to recovering the amount due to it and must return the balance
to the customer.
5/5  In the case of the Institution receiving a mortgagee from the customer,
the Institution is entitled to stipulate that the customer should make
an  assignment  to  the  Institution  to  enable  it  to  sell  the  mortgageed
213213
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
asset for the purpose of recovering the amount due from the customer
without recourse to the judiciary.
5/6  It is permissible that the contract of Murabahah consists of an under-
taking from the customer to pay an amount of money or a percentage
of  the  debt,  on  the  basis  of  undertaking  to  donate  it  in  the  event  of
a delay on his part in paying instalments on their due date. The Shariah
Supervisory Board of the Institution must have full knowledge that any
such amount is indeed spent on charitable causes, and not for the ben-
efit of the Institution itself.
5/7  It is not permissible to extend the date of payment of the debt in exchange
for an additional payment in case of rescheduling, irrespectively of
whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent.
5/8  When  there  is  default  in  payment  by  the  customer  with  regard  to
instalments of the selling price that are due, the amount due is just
the amount of the unpaid selling price. It is not permissible for the
Institution to impose any additional payment on the customer for
the Institutions benefit. This provision is, however, subject to item
5/6 .
5/9  It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution  to  give  up  part  of  the  selling
price if the customer pays early, provided this was not part of the
contractual agreement.
5/10 If the customer wishes to pay in a currency different from Murabahah
currency, it is permissible, with the agreement of the Institution at
the time of payment on condition that the payable debt is paid in
full  or  the  amount  agreed  to  be  paid  in  different  currency  is  paid
in full and no part of the currency exchange amount remains due.
This  currency  exchange  may  not  be  stipulated  in  the  contract  of
Murabahah.

Brief History of
 the Preparation of the Standard
In its meeting No. (1) held on 11 Dhul-Hajjah 1419 A.H., corresponding
to 27 February 1999 A.D., the Shariah Board decided to give priority to
the preparation of a Standard setting out the Shariah rules for Murabahah.
On Tuesday 13 Dhul-Hajjah 1419 A.H., corresponding to 30 March 1999
A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee recommended to the Shariah
Board the commissioning of a Shariah consultant to prepare a juristic study
and an exposure draft of the Shariah Rules for Murabahah.
In its meeting held on 13-14 Rajab 1420 A.H., corresponding to 22-
23 October 1999 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee discussed
the exposure draft of the Shariah Rules for Murabahah, and asked the
consultant to make the amendments in light of the comments made by
the members.
The revised exposure draft of the Shariah Rules was presented to the
Shariah Board in its meeting No. (2) held in Mecca on 10-15 Ramadan
1420  A.H.,  corresponding  to  18-22  December  1999  A.D.  The  Shariah
Board  made  further  amendments  to  the  exposure  draft  of  the  Shariah
Rules and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested
parties  in  order  to  obtain  their  comments  in  order  to  discuss  them  in
a public hearing.
A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 2930 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H.,
corresponding  to  4-5  April  2000  A.D.  The  public  hearing  was  attended
by  more  than  30  participants  representing  central  banks,  institutions,
accounting firms, Shariah scholars, academics and others who are interested
in this field. The members responded to the written comments that were
218218
Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
sent prior to the public hearing as well as to the oral comments that were
expressed in the public hearing.
The Shariah Studies Committee and the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee
held a joint meeting on 21-23 Muharram 1421 A.H., corresponding to 26-28
April  2000  A.D.,  to  discuss  the  comments  made  about  the  exposure  draft
of  the  Shariah  Rules.  The  joint  meeting  made  the  necessary  amendments,
which it deemed necessary in light of the discussions that took place in the
public hearing.
The Shariah Board in its meeting No. (4) held on 2527 Safar 1421 A.H.,
corresponding to 2931 May 2000 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah
discussed the amendments made by the Shariah Studies Committee and the
Fatwa and Arbitration Committee, and made the necessary amendments,
which it deemed necessary. The standard was adopted with the name of
Shariah  Rules  for  the  Murabahah.  Some  paragraphs  were  adopted  by
the unanimous vote of the members of the Shariah Board, while the other
paragraphs were adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded
in the minutes of the Shariah Board.
The Shariah Board decided in its meeting No. (7) held in Makkah Al-
Mukarramah on 9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H., corresponding 24-28 November
2001 A.D., to pass a resolution to reformat all Shariah rules in a form of
standards and a committee was formed for this purpose.
In its meeting No. (8) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah on 28 Safar
- 4 Rabi I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., the Shariah
Board adopted the reformatting of the Shariah Rules for Investment and
Financing No. (1) on Murabahah with the name of Shariah Standard No.
(8) on Murabahah.
The Shariah Standards Review Committee reviewed the standard in
its  meeting  held  in  Rabi  II,  1433  A.H.,  corresponding  to  March  2012
A.D.,  in  the  State  of  Qatar,  and  proposed  after  deliberation  a  set  of
amendments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary,
and then submitted the proposed amendments to the Shariah Board for
approval as it deemed necessary.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Preface on the Permissibility of Murabahah
Definition of Murabahah
Murabahah  is  selling  a  commodity  as  per  the  purchasing  price  with
a defined and agreed profit mark-up. This mark-up may be a percentage of
the selling price or a lump sum. This transaction may be concluded either
without a prior promise to buy, in which case it is called an ordinary Mura-
bahah, or with a prior promise to buy submitted by a person interested in
acquiring goods through the Institution, in which case it is called a banking
Murabahah i.e. Murabahah to the purchase orderer. This transaction is one
of the trust-based contracts that depends on transparency as to the actual
purchasing price or cost price in addition to common expenses.
Permissibility of Murabahah
The authorities for the permissibility of Murabahah are authorities on
the permissibility of sale. Among them is the saying of Allah, the exalted:
(...Allah  has  permitted  trade...).(3)(3)  Some  scholars  has  also  cited  to
(...Allah  has  permitted  trade...)
  Some  scholars  has  also  cited  to
support the permissibility of Murabahah the saying of Allah, the Exalted:
(It  is  no  crime  for  you  to  seek  the  bounty  of  your  Lord,)(4)(4)  arguing
(It  is  no  crime  for  you  to  seek  the  bounty  of  your  Lord,)
  arguing
that  the  bounty  mentioned  here  means  profit.  The  Murabahah  is  also
analogous to a form of sale called
 (which means to sell as per
Tawliyyah (which means to sell as per
analogous to a form of sale called Tawliyyah
the purchasing price without making profit). This is because the Prophet
(peace be upon him) purchased a she-camel from Abu Bakr to use it as
a transportation to immigrate to Medina. Abu Bakr wanted to give it to
the Prophet (peace be upon him) free of charge, but the Prophet refused

Promise from the Purchase Orderer
  The basis for the permissibility of responding to the application of the
The basis for the permissibility of responding to the application of the
customer  that  the  Institution  buys  the  commodity  from  a  particular
supplier is because such a demand will not affect the acquisition of the
commodity by the Institution, especially in view of the fact that this de-
mand is not binding. The Institution is entitled to acquire the commodity
from  another  supplier  provided  the  commodity  complies  with  the  de-
sired specification. The customer may be forced to fulfil his obligation
on the basis of general sources of the Qur`an and Sunnah that require
fulfilment of obligation and undertaking. The International Fiqh Acade-
my has issued a resolution endorsing a unilateral binding promise.(5)(5) The

The  basis  for  allowing  price  quotations  be  submitted  in  the  name  of

acceptance by the customer. The basis why it is preferred that the quotation
be submitted in the name of the Institution, is to avoid confusion and this

  The basis for not allowing a Murabahah deal when the customer accepts
The basis for not allowing a Murabahah deal when the customer accepts
the deal directly from the supplier is because, by this, a sale contract has

this is a form of condition that is permissible.

 The basis
for preferring that the Institution appoint an agent other than the purchase
orderer in case of the need to do so is to avoid a fictitious transaction that
shows on paper that the acquisition is made on behalf of the Institution.
This is necessary in order that the Institution appear as the real purchaser
and in order to demarcate the liabilities of the parties, the liability of the
Institution and the liability of the purchase orderer after the sale contract.

  The basis for the requirement of possession before a sale contract is to
The basis for the requirement of possession before a sale contract is to
ensure that the Institution becomes liable for the risk of destruction of
the commodity before it is entitled to sell it.
  The basis for separating an agency contract from a Murabahah transac-
The basis for separating an agency contract from a Murabahah transac-
tion is to be sure that there is no any intentional arrangement to connect
the two contracts.
  The basis for the rule that constructive possession is sufficient to meet the
The basis for the rule that constructive possession is sufficient to meet the
requirement of possession and that possession is according to the nature
of the items is because the Shariah did not state a particular form for pos-
session. Rather this is left to the customary practices. Again, the purpose
of possession is to enable one to have control over something. Therefore,
any procedure that serves this objective would be regarded as possession.
  The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  contract  of  agency  be  separate
The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  contract  of  agency  be  separate
from the contract of sale on a Murabahah basis is because of the risk that
the contracts may be connected to each other.
The basis for the rule that the Institution bear the expenses of insurance
  The basis for the rule that the Institution bear the expenses of insurance
is because these expenses follow ownership of the goods.
Conclusion of a Murabahah Contract
  The basis for the rule that the Institution is entitled to compensation in
The basis for the rule that the Institution is entitled to compensation in
case of breach of a binding promise by the customer to buy the goods is
because of the damage that may be inflicted on the Institution due to the
act of the customer. This is because the customer has caused the Institu-
tion to enter into a deal that it would not have concluded in the absence
of the promise. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a res-
(19)
olution in this respect.(19)
olution in this respect.
  The basis for the rule that the Institutions rights are limited, in case of
The basis for the rule that the Institutions rights are limited, in case of
breach of promise, to the difference between the cost of the item to the
Institution and its selling price to a third party is because the lawful right
in a guarantee is limited to the amount that compensates for the damage
suffered and because the Institutions right to recover loss of its mark-up
is irrational since there is no mark-up unless there is actually a Muraba-
hah transaction and in this case there is no such transaction.

Shariah Standard No. (8): Murabahah
  The  basis  for  the  requirement  of  transparency  as  to  the  cost  price  is
The  basis  for  the  requirement  of  transparency  as  to  the  cost  price  is
because Murabahah is a trust related contract that requires disclosure
of  the  amount  and  the  currency  of  the  cost  price  because  a  price  in
a deferred payment sale is higher.
The basis for allowing normal expenses to be included in computing the
  The basis for allowing normal expenses to be included in computing the
selling price of the commodity is because these expenses are paid to a third
party.
  The basis for entitlement of the buyer to benefit from the discount acquired
The basis for entitlement of the buyer to benefit from the discount acquired
by the Institution is because Murabahah is a mark-up sale. Therefore, if the
previous purchasing price decreases then the cost price is the amount that
remains after the discount and this price is the cost price for the purpose of
the Murabahah.
The basis for the requirement that the price and the profit in Murabahah
  The basis for the requirement that the price and the profit in Murabahah
must be determined is to avoid uncertainty and lack of knowledge.
The basis for the requirement that the profit must be separately disclosed
  The basis for the requirement that the profit must be separately disclosed
from the cost price and that it is not allowed to be calculated as a single
amount  for  the  customer  is  because  Murabahah  is  a  sale  with  a  profit
margin.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  this  profit  be  disclosed  separately  to
ensure that the customer will agree to it.
  The basis for the permissibility of instalment payment is because Mu-
The basis for the permissibility of instalment payment is because Mu-
rabahah is one of the sale contracts that are subject to spot payment,
deferred payment or instalment payment. The basis for the impermissi-
bility of requesting an additional sum of money for delay in payment is
because this is the prohibited Riba.
  The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a defect exclusion item is
The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a defect exclusion item is
because a buyer is entitled to require guaranteeing hidden defects which
are related to the sold commodity by the seller. However, the buyer may
relinquish this right by agreeing to a defect exclusion item, as stated by
(20)
a number of scholars.(20)

Guarantees in Murabahah and Treatment of Murabahah Receivables

The basis for the condition that all instalments will become due if there is
delay in payment is the Hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him: Mus-
lims are bound by the conditions they made, and because payment on
a deferred basis is the right of the buyer, and the buyer may choose to pay
before time and relinquish the deferral of the date of payment entirely
or make payment of all instalments contingent on default on payment of
one instalment.
The  basis  for  demanding  collateral  to  secure  payment  is  because  such
  The  basis  for  demanding  collateral  to  secure  payment  is  because  such
a requirement does not affect the contract; rather, it consolidates perfor-
mance and such guarantees are relevant to contracts involving credit.
The basis for not allowing a stipulation that delays transfer of ownership
  The basis for not allowing a stipulation that delays transfer of ownership
is because such a stipulation is against the effect of a sale contract, which
is immediate transfer of ownership. The basis for allowing the Institution
to hold up registering the commodity in the name of the customer until
payment is realised is that such an action does not affect the transfer of
ownership to the buyer.
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  stipulating  a  condition,  whereby  the
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  stipulating  a  condition,  whereby  the
debtor in case of default is obliged to donate a sum of money in addition to
the amount of the debt to be spent by the Institution on charitable causes,
is because this has been considered as an instance of the commitment to
make a donation, which is well established in the Maliki school of law. This

such deferred payment is not one of the essential conditions of such transaction,
as there is also a Murabahah arranged with no deferral of payment. In this case,
the seller only receives a mark-up that only includes the profit for a spot sale and
not the extra charge it would, otherwise, receive for deferral of payment.

IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MOST MERCIFUL
All praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, and blessings and peace be
upon our master, Muhammad, and his household and all his companions
Preface
This  standard  outlines  the  basis  of  the  Shariah  rulings  on  Ijarah  and
Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, beginning with the rules relating to the promise
to lease, if any, and concluding with the rules of repossession of the leased
property in an operating Ijarah by the lessor or transferring its ownership in
case of Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, within or by the end of the lease term.
The  Standard  also  aims  to  outline  the  Shariah  requirements  that  must  be
observed  by  Islamic  financial  Institutions  (Institution/Institutions)(2)(2)  with
observed  by  Islamic  financial  Institutions  (Institution/Institutions)
  with
respect to Ijarah transactions.
 The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
(2)(2) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
institutions including Islamic Banks.

Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers operating leases of properties or Ijarah Muntahia
Bittamleek, whether the Institution is the lessor or the lessee.
  This  standard  does  not  cover  Sukuk  al-Ijarah
  This  standard  does  not  cover
,  as  they  are  covered  by
Sukuk  al-Ijarah,  as  they  are  covered  by
Shariah Standard on Investment Sukuk, nor the employment of persons
(labour contract), as it is covered by a separate standard.
2. Promise to Lease (an Asset)
2/1  In  principle,  an  Ijarah  contract  is  executed  for  an  asset  owned  by
the lessor or an usufruct owned by the sub-lessor. However, it is for
a customer to request an Institution to acquire the asset or to acquire
the usufruct of an existing asset which the customer wishes to take
on lease.
2/2  In principle, Ijarah may be effected directly on the asset without any
any
2/2  In principle, Ijarah may be effected directly on the asset without
requirement of a preceding master agreement. However, it is permissible
to have a master agreement drawn up coveringa number of Ijarah
transactions between the Institution and the customer, setting out
the  general  terms  and  conditions  of  agreement  between  the  two
parties. In this case, there may either be a separate lease contract for
each transaction, in a specific written document signed by the two
notices of offer
parties, or alternatively the two parties may exchange notices of offer
parties, or alternatively the two parties may exchange
and acceptance by referring to the terms and
conditions contained in
and acceptance by referring to the terms and conditions contained in
the master agreement.
2/3  It is permissible for the Institution to require the customer who has
promised to lease to pay a sum of money to the Institution to ensure
the customers seriousness in accepting a lease on the asset and the
subsequent obligations, provided no amount is to be deducted from
238238
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
this sum except in proportion to the actual damage suffered by the
Institution in case the customer does not fulfil his promise. Thus, if
the customer, in case of Ijarah associated with a promise
to transfer
the customer, in case of Ijarah associated with a promise to transfer
ownership, breaches his promise, the promisor shall be charged either
the  difference  between  the  cost  of  the  asset  intended  to  be  leased
and the total lease rentals for the asset which is leased on the basis of
Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek to a third party, or, in case of operating
Ijarah,  the  promisor  breaching  his  promise  shall  be  charged  the
difference between the cost of acquisition and the total selling price
if sold to a third party by the Institution (promisee). Otherwise; i.e.,
in case it is not sold, the promisee shall not be entitled to receive any
compensation.
2/4  The amount of money deposited by the customer as security for
his  commitment  can  be  either  held  on  trust  in  the  custody  of  the
Institution in which case the latter cannot invest it, or it may be held
on an investment trust basis in which case the customer permits the
Institution to invest it on the basis of Mudarabah between the customer
and the Institution. It is permissible to agree with the customer, upon
the execution of the contract of lease, that this amount shall be treated
as an advance payment of the instalments of the lease rental.
3. Acquisition of the Asset to Be Leased, or Its Usufruct, by the Institution
3/1  For the permissibility of an Ijarah contract concerning a specified
asset, the lease contract should be preceded by acquisition of either
the asset to be leased or the usufruct of that asset.
3/1/1 If the asset or the usufruct thereof is owned by the Institution,
which  should  in  principle  be  the  case,  an  Ijarah  contract
may may be executed as soon as agreement is reached by the two
be executed as soon as agreement is reached by the two
parties.
3/1/2 However, if the asset is to be acquired by the customer [see
item 3/2 below], or by a third party, the Ijarah contract shall
not be executed unless and until the Institution has acquired
that asset.
239239
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
  Ownership is possible under a sale contract, even if the title is not
registered in the purchasers name (the Institution), and the purchaser
has the right to obtain a counter-deed to establish the actual transfer
of his ownership of the asset. [see item 3/5 below]
3/2  An asset may be acquired by a party and then leased to that party. In
this case, the Ijarah transaction should not be stipulated as a condition
of the purchase contract by which the Institution acquires the asset.
3/3  A lessee of an asset may enter into a sub-lease contract with a party
other  than  the  owner  for  a  rental  that  is  either  the  same,  lower  or
higher, payable either currently or on a deferred basis, unless the owner
stipulates that the lessee should not  assign or sublet the property to
stipulates that the lessee should not assign or sublet the property to
third parties, or should not do so without his approval.
3/4  The  lessee  may  lease  the  asset  back  to  its  owner  in  the  first  lease
period  for  a  rental  that  is  lower,  same  or  higher  than  what  he  is
paying, if the two rentals are paid on a spot basis. However, this is
not permissible if it should lead to contract of Inah, by varying the
rent or the duration. For example, it is not permissible, if the first
rental is one hundred dinars payable on a spot basis, for the lessee
to sublet it to the lessor for one hundred and ten dinars payable on
a deferred basis, or if the first rental is one hundred and ten dinars
payable on a deferred basis, for the second to be for one hundred
dinars payable instantly, or if the two rentals are of the same amount,
but the payment of the first rental is deferred for one month and the
second rental is deferred for two months.
3/5  An Ijarah contract may be executed for an asset undertaken by the
lessor to be delivered to the lessee according to accurate specifications,
even if the asset so described is not owned by the lessor. In this case,
an agreement is reached to make the described asset available during
the  duration  of  the  contract,  giving  the  lessor  the  opportunity  to
acquire or to produce it. It is not a requirement of this lease that the
rental should be paid in advance as long as the lease is not executed
according to the contract of Salam (or Salaf). Should the lessee receive
240240
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
an asset that does not conform to the description, then he is entitled
to reject it and demand an asset that conforms to the description.
3/6  An Institutions customer may jointly acquire an asset that he wishes
to  lease  with  the  Institution,  and  then  lease  the  Institutions  share
of the asset from the Institution. In this case, the rental specified as
receivable by the Institution should only be in proportion to its share
in the ownership of the asset, since the lessee is a co-owner of the
asset and therefore has to pay rent only on the share that he does not
own.
3/7  An Institution may appoint one of its customers to act as its agent
in acquiring on its behalf an asset that is desired by that customer
such as equipment, machinery, etc., whose description and price are
fixed with a view to the Institutions leasing such asset or assets to
the  customer  after  it  has  acquired  their  ownership  through  either
actual or constructive possession. Although this type of agency (for
the purchase of the assets) is permissible, it is always preferred that
the agent is someone other than the customer (prospective lessee) as
far as possible.
4. Concluding an Ijarah Contract and the Forms of Ijarah
4/1  Signature of the contract and the consequences thereof
4/1/1 The lease contract is a binding contract which neither party
may terminate or alter without the others consent [see items
5/2/2, 7/2/1, and 7/2/2]. However, an Ijarah contract may be
terminated in accordance with item 7/2/1.
4/1/2 The  duration  of  an  Ijarah  contract  must  be  specified  in  the
contract. The period of Ijarah should commence on the date
of execution of the contract, unless the two parties agree on
a  specified  future  commencement  date,  resulting  in  a  future
a  specified  future  commencement date, resulting in  a  future
Ijarah, that is, an Ijarah contract to be executed at a future date.
4/1/3 If the lessor fails to deliver the asset to the lessee on the date
specified in the Ijarah contract, no rental is due for the period
241241
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
between  the  date  specified  in  the  contract  and  the  date  of
actual delivery, and the rental should be reduced accordingly,
unless it is agreed that the lease be extended by an equivalent
period after its original expiry date.
4/1/4 Arboun (Earnest Money) may be taken in respect of lease at
the execution of the contract of lease, with the lessee having
the right to terminate the contract during a specified period
of  time,  and  Arboun  is  treated  as  an  advance  payment  of
the rental. If the Ijarah contract is not executed for a reason
attributable to the lessee, the lessor may retain the Arboun.
However,  it  is  preferable  for  the  Institution  to  forgo  any
amount in excess of the actual damage it has suffered. [see
para. 3/2]
4/2  Forms of the Ijarah contract
4/2/1 Ijarah contracts may be executed in respect of the same asset
for  different  periods  for  several  lessees,  provided  that  two
contracts are not executed in respect of the same asset for the
same period. Such an arrangement is called successive leases,
because  each  Ijarah  is  considered  as  being  successive  to  the
previous  one  and  not  concurrent  with  it  on  the  basis  of  its
being a future Ijarah. [see item 4/1/2 above]
4/2/2  If  the  lessor  signs  an  Ijarah  contract  for  a  particular  asset  for
a specified period of time, he cannot sign another Ijarah contract
with another lessee for the duration of the existing Ijarah period
or for any remaining period thereof. [see item 7/1/2 below]
4/2/3 An  Ijarah  contract  may  be  signed  with  several  lessees  being
entitled  to  the  same  specified  usufruct  of  a  particular  asset
and  duration  of  rent,  without  specifying  a  particular  period
of time for a particular person. In this case, each lessee may
benefit  from  the  property  during  the  time  assigned  to  him
in  accordance  with  specified  rules.  This  case  is  one  form  of
Muhaya`ah (time-sharing) in benefiting from the usufruct.
242242
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
4/2/4 A lessee may invite others to share with him in the usufruct he
owns. In this case, they become co-owners in the usufruct of
the leased property. This can only be done before entering into
a  sub-lease.  If  the  property  is  sub-leased  after  the  co-owners
having owned the usufruct each co-owner is entitled to a share
in the sub-lease rental pro rata to his share in the usufruct.
5. Subject Matter of Ijarah
5/1  Rules governing benefit and leased property
5/1/1 The leased asset must be capable of being used while preserving
the asset, and the benefit from an Ijarah must be permissible by
Shariah. For example, a house or a chattel may not be leased for
the purpose of an impermissible act by the lessee, such as leasing
premises to be used as headquarters by an Institution dealing
in interest or to a shopkeeper for selling or storing prohibited
goods, or leasing a vehicle to transport prohibited merchandise.
5/1/2 The subject matter of Ijarah may be a share in an undivided
asset  held  in  common  with  the  lessee,  whether  the  lessee  is
a  partner  with  the  lessor  or  not.  In  this  case  the  lessee  may
benefit  from  the  leased  share  in  the  same  way  in  which  the
lessor used to benefit from it, i.e., by usufruct division based on
Muhyaah i.e. by identifying a particular time (time-sharing)
or a particular part of the property, used alternately by the co-
owners, or any other means with consent of the other partner.
5/1/3 An Ijarah contract may be executed for a house or a chattel, even
with a non-Muslim, if the use to be made of it is permissible,
such as a house for residential purposes, a car for transport, or
a computer to store data, unless the lessor knows in advance, or
has reason to presume, that the use of the asset to be leased will
be for an impermissible purpose.
5/1/4 The lessee must use the leased asset in a suitable manner or in
conformity with common practice, and comply with conditions
which  are  acceptable  in  Shariah.  He  must  also  avoid  causing
243243
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
damage  to  the  leased  asset  by  misuse  through  misconduct  or
negligence.
5/1/5 The  lessor  must  accept  responsibility  for  any  defects  of  the
leased asset which impair the intended use of the asset, and may
not exclude his liability for any impairment that the leased asset
may  sustain,  either  by  his  own  doing  or  as  a  result  of  events
outside  his  control,  which  affect  the  benefits  intended  to  be
available under the Ijarah contract.
5/1/6  If the benefit from the leased asset is impaired wholly or partially
partially
5/1/6  If the benefit from the leased asset is impaired wholly or
as a result of the lessees misconduct, while the property remains
under lease, the lessee is obliged to restore or repair the usufruct,
and rent for the time during which the benefit is lost is not to be
waived.
5/1/7 The lessor may not stipulate that the lessee will undertake the
major maintenance of the asset that is required to keep it in
the  condition  necessary  to  provide  the  contractual  benefits
under the lease. The lessor may delegate to the lessee the task
of  carrying  out  such  maintenance  at  the  lessors  cost.  The
lessee  should  carry  out  operating  or  periodical  (ordinary)
maintenance.
5/1/8  The leased asset is the responsibility of the lessor throughout the
the
5/1/8  The leased asset is the responsibility of the lessor throughout
duration of the Ijarah, unless the lessee commits misconduct
or negligence. The lessor may take out permissible insurance
on  it  whenever  possible,  and  such  insurance  expenses  must
be borne by the lessor. The lessor may take this into account
implicitly when the lease rental is to be fixed. However, he may
not, after the contract is signed, charge the lessee any cost in
excess of the cost anticipated at the time of fixing the rent. The
lessor  may  also  delegate  to  the  lessee  the  task  of  taking  out
insurance at the lessors expense.
5/2  Rules governing lease rentals
5/2/1 The lease rental may be in cash or in kind (goods) or benefit
(service). The rental must be specified, either as a lump sum
244244
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
covering the duration of the Ijarah contract, or by instalments
for parts of the duration. It may also be for a fixed or variable
amount,  according  to  whatever  designated  method  the  two
parties agree upon. [see item 5/2/3 below]
5/2/2 The rental is made obligatory by the contract and the lessors
entitlement to the rental runs from the time when the lessee
starts  to  benefit  from  the  asset  or  once  the  lessor  makes  the
usufruct of the asset available to the lessee, and the entitlement
to  the  rental  does  not  necessarily  commence  on  the  date  of
signing the Ijarah contract. The rental may be paid entirely in
advance or in instalments during a period equivalent, or more
or  less,  to  the  duration  of  the  Ijarah.  However,  if  the  asset  is
made available only after a period longer than what customary
practices deem proper, then no payment shall be obligatory.
5/2/3 In  case  the  rental  is  subject  to  changes  (floating  rental),  it  is
In  case  the  rental  is  subject  to  changes  (floating  rental),  it  is
5/2/3
necessary that the amount of the rental of the first period of the
Ijarah contract be specified in lump sum. It is then permissible
that the rentals for subsequent periods be determined accord-
ing  to  a  certain  benchmark.  Such  benchmark  must  be  based
on a clear formula which is not subject to dispute, because it
becomes the determining factor for the rentals of the remain-
ing periods. This benchmark should be subject to a ceiling, on
both maximum and minimum levels.
5/2/4 It may be agreed that the rental should consist of two specified
parts: one to be paid or transferred to the lessor and the other
to be held by the lessee to cover any expenses or costs approved
by the lessor, such as the cost of major maintenance, insurance,
etc. The excess of the second part of the rental shall be treated
as an advance to the lessor on account, while the lessor shall
bear any shortage.
5/2/5  The amendment of future rentals is permissible by the agreement
of both parties, i.e. the periods for which the lessee has not yet
received any benefit. The rentals of any previous periods which
245245
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
have not yet been paid become a debt owed to the lessor by the
lessee, and therefore cannot be increased.
6. Guarantees and Treatment of Ijarah Receivables
6/1  Permissible security, of all kinds, may be taken to secure the rental
payments or as a security against misuse or negligence on the part of
the lessee, such as a charge over assets, guarantees or an assignment of
rights over assets of the lessee held by third parties, even if such rights
are a permissible life or property insurance indemnity in favour of the
lessee.
6/2  The two parties may agree that the rental be paid fully in advance. It
is also permissible to make the rent payable in instalments, in which
case the lessor may stipulate that the lessee should immediately pay
the remaining instalments if he, after receiving a specified period of
due notice, delays, without a valid reason, payment of one instalment
or more, provided that the asset shall be made available for the lessee
to  use  for  the  remaining  period  of  time.  Any  stipulated  upfront
rental or accelerated -because of delay of payment- rental is subject
to settlement at the end of the Ijarah period or, if the Ijarah contract
is terminated earlier, at the time of such termination. Any extension
of time by the lessor after the stipulated time for prompt payment
is  considered  as  a  consent  to  deferral  of  payment  throughout  the
extension period and not a right of the lessee, subject always to item
5/2/2 above.
6/3  No increase in the rental due may be stipulated by the lessor in case
of delay in payment by the lessee.
6/4  It  may  be  provided  in  the  contract  of  Ijarah  or  Ijarah  Muntahia
Bittamleek  that  a  lessee  who  delays  payment  for  no  good  reason
undertakes to donate a certain amount or percentage of the rental
due  in  case  of  late  payment.  Such  donation  should  be  paid  to
charitable causes under the co-ordination of the Institutions Shariah
Supervisory Board.
6/5  In  case  of  foreclosure  of  the  security  provided  by  the  lessee,  the
lessor may deduct from such amounts only what is due in respect
246246
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
of  rental  for  previous  periods,  and  not  all  rental  instalments,
including instalments which have not yet fallen due and in respect
of periods for which the lessee has not had the benefit of the leased
asset. The lessor may also deduct from the security all legitimate
compensations necessitated by the lessees breach of contract.
7. Changes to the Ijarah Contract
7/1  Selling of or damage to the leased asset
7/1/1  If the lessor sells the leased asset to the lessee, the Ijarah contract
is terminated due to the transfer of the ownership of the leased
asset and ownership of usufruct to the lessee.
7/1/2 The lessor may sell the leased asset to a third party other than
the lessee, and the title to the asset together with the rights and
obligations of the lessor under the Ijarah contract is thereby
transferred to the new owner, because the asset and the rights
and  obligations  attached  to  it  become  the  right  of  the  third
party.  The  lessees  consent  is  not  necessary  when  the  lessor
decides to sell the asset to a third party. If the purchaser does
not know about the Ijarah contract, he may terminate the sale
contract, but if he knows about it and consents to it, he takes
the place of the previous owner in his entitlement to the rental
for the remaining period.
7/1/3  In case of total destruction of the leased asset, the Ijarah contract
contract
7/1/3  In case of total destruction of the leased asset, the Ijarah
is terminated if it is concluded on an identified asset. In such
a case, it may not be stipulated that the rest of the instalments
should be paid.
7/1/4 The leased asset in the possession of the lessee is held by the
lessee in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of the lessor. The lessee
will  not  be  held  liable  for  any  damage  or  destruction  of  the
leased asset unless such damage or destruction is a result of
misconduct or negligence on the part of the lessee. In this case,
he is obliged to replace the asset if it is replaceable; otherwise,
he is liable for the amount of the damage to be determined by
valuation.
247247
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
7/1/5 In case of the partial destruction of the leased asset in a manner
that  impairs  the  benefits  expected  from  the  leased  asset,  the
lessee  may  terminate  the  Ijarah  contract.  Both  he  and  the
lessor  may  also  agree  to  amend  the  rental  in  case  of  partial
destruction of the leased property, if the lessee waives his right
to  termination.  The  lessor  in  this  case  is  not  entitled  to  rent
for the period during which the lessee was not able to benefit
from the asset unless the lessor makes it up (by agreement with
the  lessee)  with  a  like  benefit  after  the  expiry  of  the  period
specified in the contract. [see para. 5/1/6]
7/1/6  In an Ijarah Mawsufah fi al-Dhimmah
7/1/6  In an
 (contract for an unidenti-
Ijarah Mawsufah fi al-Dhimmah (contract for an unidenti-
fied asset undertaken by the lessor to be delivered according to
the agreed specifications), the owner in cases of total and partial
destruction must offer an alternative asset having a specification
similar to that of the destroyed asset, unless otherwise agreed at
the time. The Ijarah shall continue for the remaining time of the
contract. If it is not possible to provide a substitute asset, the con-
tract will be terminated. [see item 3/5]
7/1/7 If  the  lessee  stops  using  the  leased  asset  or  returns  it  to  the
owner  without  the  owners  consent,  the  rental  will  continue
to  be  due  in  respect  of  the  remaining  period  of  the  Ijarah,
and  the  lessor  may  not  lease  the  property  to  another  lessee
for this period, but must keep it at the disposal of the current
lessee unless the lessee relinquishes to the lessor the remaining
period of time, in which case the lease expires. [see item 7/2/1
below]
7/2  Termination, expiry and renewal of the Ijarah contract
7/2/1  It is permissible to terminate the lease contract by mutual con-
sent but it is not permissible for one party to terminate it except
in case of force majeure or there is a defect in the leased asset
that materially impairs its use. Termination is also possible when
one party secures an option to terminate the contract in which
case the party who holds the option may exercise it during the
specified period.
248248
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
7/2/2 The lessor may stipulate that the Ijarah contract be terminated
if the lessee does not pay the rent or fails to pay it on time.
7/2/3 An Ijarah contract does not terminate with the death of either
party thereto. However, the heirs of the lessee may terminate
the  Ijarah  contract  if  they  can  prove  that  the  contract  has
become, as a result of the death of their legator, too onerous
for their resources and in excess of their needs.
7/2/4 An  Ijarah  contract  expires  with  the  total  destruction  of  the
leased asset in the case of leasing a specific asset or with the
inability to enjoy the usufruct owing to the loss of the benefit
that the asset was intended to provide.
7/2/5 The two parties may terminate the Ijarah contract before it
begins to run.
7/2/6  The lease expires upon the expiry of its term, but it may remain
operative for a good cause, such as the late arrival to the place
intended in the lease of transportation vehicles, and in the case
of a late harvesting period for land leased for crop cultivation.
The lease then continues with the rental based on the prevailing
market value. An Ijarah may be renewed for another term, and
such renewal may be made before the expiry of the original term
or automatically by adding a provision in the new contract for
such renewal when the new term starts, unless either party serves
a notice on the other of its desire not to renew the contract.
8. Transfer of the Ownership in the Leased Property in Ijarah Muntahia
Bittamleek
8/1  In  Ijarah  Muntahia  Bittamleek,  the  method  of  transferring  the  title
in  the  leased  asset  to  the  lessee  must  be  evidenced  in  a  document
separate from the Ijarah contract document, using one of the following
methods:
a)  By means of a promise to sell for a token or other consideration, or
by accelerating the payment of the remaining amount of rental, or
by paying the market value of the leased property.
249249
Shariah Standard No. (9): Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
b)  A promise to give it as a gift (for no consideration).
c)  A promise to give it as a gift, contingent upon the payment of the
remaining instalments.
In all these cases, the separate document evidencing a promise of
gift, promise of sale or a promise of gift contingent on a particular
event, should be independent of the contract of Ijarah Muntahia
Bittamleek and cannot be taken as an integral part of the contract
of Ijarah.
8/2  A  promise  to  transfer  the  ownership  by  way  of  one  of  the  methods
specified in item 8/1 above is a binding promise by the lessor. However,
a binding promise is binding on one party only, while the other party
must have the option not to proceed. This is to avoid a bilateral promise
by the two parties which is Shariah impermissible because it resembles
a concluded contract.
8/3  In all cases of transfer of ownership by way of gift or sale, it is neces-
sary, when the promise is fulfilled, that a new contract be drawn up,
since the ownership to the property is not automatically transferred
by virtue of the original promise document that was drawn up earlier.
8/4  In case the Ijarah contract is combined, through a separate document,
with  a  gift  contingent  upon  the  condition  that  the  remaining  rent
instalments be paid, the ownership to the leased property is transferred
to the lessee if the condition is fulfilled, without the need for any other
procedure to be adopted or a document to be signed. However, if the
lessees payment is short of even one instalment, the ownership to the
property is not transferred to him, since the condition has not been
fulfilled.
8/5  If the leased asset was purchased from the lessee before it was leased
leased
8/5  If the leased asset was purchased from the lessee before it was
back  to  the  lessee  on  the  basis  of  Ijarah  Muntahia  Bittamleek,
a (reasonable) period of time, between the lease contract and the
time  of  the  sale  of  the  asset  to  the  lessee,  must  have  expired,  to
avoid the contract of Inah. This period must be long enough so
that the leased property or its value could have changed. This shall

also apply to the case of early ownership of the asset where a sale
contract is concluded during the Ijarah. [see para. 7/1]
8/6  Subject  to  item  8/8  below,  the  rules  governing  Ijarah  must  apply
to the Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, i.e. when a promise is made by
the lessor to transfer the ownership in the leased asset to the lessee.
None of these rules should be breached under the pretext that the
leased asset was bought by the lessor on the basis of a promise by the
lessee that he would acquire it or that ownership of it would devolve
upon him, or that he would pay rentals in excess of those payable
in respect of a similar property which are similar in amount to the
instalments of an instalment sale, or that local laws and conventional
banking practices consider such a transaction as an instalment sale
with a deferred transfer of the ownership.
8/7  Transfer  of  the  ownership  in  the  leased  property  cannot  be  made
by executing, along with the Ijarah, a sale contract that will become
effective on a future date.
8/8  If the leased asset is destroyed or if the continuity of the lease contract
becomes impossible up to the expiry period without the cause being
attributable  to  the  lessee  in  either  case,  then  the  rental  is  adjusted
based on the prevailing market value. That is, the difference between
the prevailing rate of rental and the rental specified in the contract
must be refunded to the lessee if the latter rental is higher than the
former. This is to avoid loss to the lessee, who agreed to a higher rental
payment compared to the prevailing rate of rental in consideration of
the lessors promise to pass the title to him upon the expiry of the lease
term.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
In its meeting No. (1) held on 11 Dhul-Hajjah 1419 A.H., corresponding
to  27  February  1999  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Board  decided  to  give  priority
to the preparation of the Shariah rules for Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia
Bittamleek.
On  Tuesday  13  Dhul-Hajjah  1419  A.H.,  corresponding  to  30  March
1999 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee decided to commission
a Shariah consultant to prepare a juristic study and an exposure draft on
the Shariah Rules for Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek.
In its meeting held on 13-14 Rajab 1420 A.H., corresponding to 22-23
October  1999  A.D.,  the  Fatwa  and  Arbitration  Committee  discussed  the
exposure draft of the Shariah Rules for Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bitamleek,
and asked the consultant to make the amendments in light of the comments
made by the members.
The  revised  exposure  draft  of  the  Shariah  Rules  was  presented  to  the

further amendments to the exposure draft of the Shariah Rules and decided
that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties in order to
obtain their comments in order to discuss them in a public hearing.
A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 2930 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H.,
corresponding to 4-5 April 2000 A.D. The public hearing was attended by
more  than  30  participants  representing  central  Institutions,  accounting
firms, Shariah scholars, academics and others who are interested in this
field. The members responded to the written comments that were sent prior

The Shariah Standards Committee and the Fatwa and Arbitration Com-
mittee held a joint meeting on 21-23 Muharram 1421 A.H., corresponding
to 26-28 April 2000 A.D., to discuss the comments made about the Shariah
Rules. The committee made the amendments which it considered necessary
in light of the discussions that took place in the public hearing.
The Shariah Board in its meeting No. (4) held on 2527 Safar 1421 A.H.
corresponding to 2931 May 2000 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah
discussed the amendments made by the Shariah Studies Committee and
the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee, and made the amendments which
it considered necessary. Some paragraphs of the standard were adopted in
the name of Shariah Rules for Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek by
the unanimous vote of the members of the Shariah Board, while the other
paragraphs were adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded
in the minutes of the Shariah Board.
In its meeting No. (7) held on 9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H. corresponding
to 24-28 November 2001 A.D., in Makkah Al-Mukarramah, the Shariah
Board decided to convert all Shariah rules for Investments and Financing
to Standards and a committee was formed for this purpose.
In its meeting No. (8) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah on 28 Safar
- 4 Rabi I, 1423 A.H. corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., the Shariah

Muntahia Bittamleek in the name of Shariah Standard No. (9) on Ijarah
and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek. The committee did not make any changes
to the substance.
The Shariah Standards Review Committee reviewed the standard in
its meeting held in Rabi II, 1433 A.H. corresponding to March 2012 A.D.,
in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments
(additions,  deletions,  and  rephrasing)  as  deemed  necessary,  and  then
submitted the proposed amendments to the Shariah Board for approval
as it deemed necessary.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard

banks in the following respects. In hire-purchase, the terms and provisions
of  sale  and  leasing  are  applied  to  the  subject  matter  at  the  same  time,
and subsequently the ownership of the subject matter is transferred to
the lessee (buyer), once he pays the last instalment without the need for
a separate contract for the transfer of ownership. In the permissible Ijarah
Muntahia Bittamleek, on the other hand, the provisions governing Ijarah
are applied to the leased asset until the end of the Ijarah term, after which
the lessee obtains ownership of the asset in the manner explained in this
Standard.

Promise to Lease an Asset
The basis for allowing the Institution to demand payment of money by
a party who has promised to take the property as lessee is the need to confirm
the  commitment  of  the  promissor.  This  is  because  a  binding  promise  has
financial  implications  if  the  promissor  retracts  the  promise.  The  request
for payment of a commitment fee is to cater for financial damage that the
Institution may have incurred as a result of the promissor taking back the
promise or defaulting in payment. The unified Shariah Supervisory Board

  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  sub-leasing  when  the  lessor  has
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  sub-leasing  when  the  lessor  has
allowed it is because the lessee has ownership of the usufruct by virtue of
the Ijarah contract, in which case he is entitled to transfer such usufruct
for consideration as he deems fit. The basis for impermissibility of sub-
leasing when the lessor has not allowed it is because the ownership of
usufruct by the lessee is limited in which case the lessee is obliged to
consider any limitations on this ownership.
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  leasing  a  property  on  the  basis  of
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of leasing  a  property  on  the  basis  of
specifications even if the lessor does not own it is that this will not lead
to dispute, in which case it is similar to a Salam contract. However, in
this case the lessor should not request advance payment of the rentals
according to one of the views of the Shafiis and Hanbalis.
The basis for preferring that the agent who purchases on behalf of the
  The basis for preferring that the agent who purchases on behalf of the
Institution  be  someone  other  than  the  customer  (lessee)  is  to  avoid
fictitious transactions and to demonstrate the genuine role of the Insti-
tution in making the usufruct of the asset available to the lessee.

involves time and for this it is relevant that it be contingent on future
events.
  The basis for the permissibility of obtaining Arboun (Earnest Money)
The basis for the permissibility of obtaining Arboun (Earnest Money)
to  secure  performance  is  the  practice  of  Umar  Ibn  Al-Khattab  (may
Allah be pleased with him) in the presence of some companions of the

Ahmad. A resolution has been issued in connection with the permis-
sibility of Arboun (Earnest Money) by the International Islamic Fiqh
(12)
Academy.(12)
Academy.
  The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  re-leasing  after  the  lease  of  the
The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  re-leasing  after  the  lease  of  the
asset is that under the first contract, the usufruct of the asset no longer
belongs to the owner, and a new contract may not be signed with another
lessee  before  the  contract  with  the  first  lessee  is  terminated.  Hence,
this form of Ijarah is not suitable as an investment instrument, because
it constitutes an impermissible sale of the rent receivable pursuant to
providing new lessees with an asset already leased out to the existing
lessee.  The  form  just  described  is  different  from  the  transfer,  by  the
owner, of the ownership of the leased assets to an investor, so that the
latter takes his place, wholly or partially, with regard to the ownership
of  all  or  some  parts  of  the  assets,  as  well  as  in  the  ownership  of  the
usufruct of, and entitlement to his share of the rent from, those assets.

the same asset after the first Ijarah contract.
The basis for allowing successive leases on the same specified usufruct of
  The basis for allowing successive leases on the same specified usufruct of
a particular asset without specifying a particular period for a particular
person is because the usufruct -in line with the term assigned to each
party- can accommodate the parties. The justification for not allowing
a  specific  term  for  each  person  is  that  each  party  will  know  the  term
to  which  he  is  entitled  in  his  turn  and  because  their  applications  are

  The basis for the requirement that incorporating co-lessees must take
The basis for the requirement that incorporating co-lessees must take
place before any sub-lease contract is signed is because sub-leasing the
property means the sub-lessor no longer owns the usufruct, and thus
he would be leasing out a benefit of the usufruct that he does not own,
which is not permissible in Shariah as stated earlier. The jurists have
considered a bankrupt lessor -a person who leases things he does not
own- among those who must be restricted in using their property.
Subject Matter of Ijarah
The basis for the requirement that the leased asset must be capable of
  The basis for the requirement that the leased asset must be capable of
being used while preserving the asset is that the subject of a lease is
usufruct and not the asset, as leasing is not possible for things that perish
by use. The basis for the requirement that benefit from Ijarah must be
permissible is that leasing an asset that will be used in impermissible
way makes the lessor an accomplice in doing evil and this is prohibited

    The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  stipulating  a  defect  exclusion
  The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  stipulating  a  defect  exclusion
clause in respect to the leased asset is that such a condition defeats the
purpose of the contract, which is exchange of usufruct for rentals. If
the usufruct is partially or wholly impaired, the receipt of the rentals by
the lessor becomes a form of unjust enrichment. The resolution of the
International Islamic Fiqh Academy has declared that the lessor must

asset insofar as these events are not sustained as a result of misconduct

Again, using a benchmark to determine the rentals is to the benefit of
all parties since there is possibility of rental fluctuation that may be

contract remains binding on both parties throughout its term. This

  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  restructuring  the  rentals  for  the
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  restructuring  the  rentals  for  the
future periods is that such an act is deemed to create a new contract for
a new term for which the rentals are not yet due. Hence, the rentals are
not  regarded  as  a  debt,  in  which  case  the  prohibition  of  rescheduling
rentals in return for higher payment is not applicable to this. However,
increasing previously agreed rentals in exchange for a deferred period of
payment is a form of Riba.

that bases acceleration of payment on the event of default in payment.
  The basis of the prohibition of increasing the amount of lease receivables
The basis of the prohibition of increasing the amount of lease receivables
in exchange for a deferral of payment is because this is a form of Riba.
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  stipulating  that  a  solvent  debtor
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  stipulating  that  a  solvent  debtor
should undertake to make a payment to charity in case of default is that
this is similar to an undertaking to make a donation that is approved by
the Maliki scholars, notably Abdullah Ibn Nafi and Muhammad Ibn

Changes to the Ijarah Contract
  The basis for allowing the lessor to sell the leased asset to a third party
The basis for allowing the lessor to sell the leased asset to a third party
without the consent of the lessee is that the lessor owns the asset and is
acting within the limits of his ownership without affecting the right of the
lessee that is materialised in the usufruct. If the Ijarah expires, enabling
the  buyer  to  take  possession  of  the  asset  is  sufficient  to  discharge  the
seller from any responsibility as to delivery in which case the buyer will
own the asset excluding the right of the lessee to the usufruct which is
attached to the asset even if the ownership is transferred. The Shariah

permissibility of terminating the lease contract in case
of intervening contingencies or force majeure is that there is a pressing

The basis of the rule that Ijarah does not terminate with the death of
either party thereto is that the subject-matter of the contract is the asset
and as long as the asset is available the Ijarah contract remains unaffected.
The basis for the right of the lessees heirs to terminate the Ijarah if they
can prove that the contract has become too onerous for their resources is
to avoid inflicting damage on the heirs. This exceptional ruling is taken
from the Maliki School of law since it serves the interests of the lessee.
The heirs of the lessor may not terminate the Ijarah in the event of the
death of the lessor because there is no potential damage to them, as they
will receive the rentals for the remainder of the term of the contract.

The basis for allowing recourse to the prevailing market rate of rental
when the transfer of ownership becomes impossible without any cause

lessee has paid more than the prevailing rate of rental in order to acquire
title to the asset. If this acquisition of title becomes impossible, then the
rental must be adjusted retrospectively to the prevailing market rate. This
ruling is analogous to the principle that the price must be discounted
when a sold crop has suffered damages due natural calamities.

Preface
The aim of the standard is to explain the rules for and limitations of
Salam and Parallel Salam in respect to concluding a Salam contract, the
subject matter of Salam and changes to the contract, whether in the event
of  ability  to  deliver  or  otherwise.  The  standard  also  explains  rulings  in
respect to issuing Salam Sukuk.
271271
Shariah Standard No. (10): Salam and Parallel Salam
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  Salam  and  Parallel  Salam  transactions,  whether
the Institution is the buyer or the seller, and issuing Salam Sukuk. This
standard does not cover Istisnaa (manufacturing or supplier contract)
because the latter is covered by a separate standard.
2. Contract of Salam
2/1  General framework for Salam contracts
2/1/1 It is permissible to initiate through negotiations several Salam
contracts (with different parties). Each operation will end at its
due date. It is also permissible to draw up a general framework
or  a  master  agreement  that  consists  of  an  understanding  to
conclude successive Salam contracts, each of which will take
place at an appropriate time. In this latter case, the transaction
involved shall be concluded on the basis of a memorandum of
understanding in which the contracting parties determine the
framework of the contract and the intention of the parties to
buy and sell. The parties shall also determine the quantity and
specifications of the goods, the manner of their delivery, the
basis for determining the price, and the manner of payment.
The types of guarantees and other prospective arrangements
shall  also  be  specified  in  the  memorandum.  The  execution
of each Salam contract may then take place separately at the
appropriate date.
2/1/2 If  the  Salam  contract  is  concluded  on  the  basis  of  what  was
initially  agreed  in  the  memorandum  of  understanding,  the
contents of the memorandum become part and parcel of the
when the
contract. This will hold true unless the parties agreed when the
contract. This will hold true unless the parties agreed
272272
Shariah Standard No. (10): Salam and Parallel Salam
contract was concluded to exempt themselves from some of the
obligations referred to in the memorandum of understanding.
2/2  Form of a Salam contract
  A contract of Salam may be concluded using the word Salam, or Salaf,
or sale, or any term that indicates sale of a prescribed commodity for
deferred delivery in exchange for immediate payment of the price.
3. Subject Matter of Salam
3/1  Capital of Salam contract and its conditions
3/1/1 It is permissible for the capital of Salam to be in the form of
fungible  goods  (such  as  wheat  and  other  cereals)  in  which
case  the  parties  must  make  sure  that  they  do  not  fall  into
Riba. The capital may also be items of material value (such as
livestock). It is also permissible for it to be in the form of the
general usufruct of a particular asset, such as living in a house
or having the use of an aircraft or a ship for a certain period.
In such a case, when a party is granted access to the usufruct
through  delivery  of  the  asset,  this  is  regarded  as  immediate
receipt (possession) of the Salam capital.
3/1/2 The capital of Salam should be made known to the two parties
in a manner that removes all uncertainty and eliminates the
possibility of dispute. In principle, the capital of Salam should
be in the form of cash. In this case, the currency of payment, the
amount and the manner of payment shall be clearly defined.
If the capital of Salam is in the form of fungibles,(1)(1) then the
If the capital of Salam is in the form of fungibles,
 then the
kind, type, specifications and quantity of these shall be clearly
defined.
3/1/3 The capital in a Salam contract must be paid immediately at the
exception
place where the contract is concluded. However, as an exception

to this ruling, payment may be delayed for two or three days at

 Fungibles are goods that share common features such that they do not differ significantly.
Any fungibles can be replaced by any other in the event of destruction, without need to
assess the value of the item destroyed or the one replacing it.

most. Even if such a short delay has been stipulated earlier, this
will not affect the Salam contract provided that the period of
delay is not equal to or greater than the delivery period for al-
Muslam Fihi.
3/1/4 It is not permitted that a debt be recognised as the capital of
Salam,  such  as  using  as  the  capital  of  Salam  loans  or  debts
owed  by  the  seller  to  the  Institution  as  a  result  of  previous
transactions.
 3/2 Al-Muslam Fihi and its conditions
3/2/1 Salam  contracts  are  permitted  for  fungible  goods,  like  those
that  may  be  weighed,  measured  or  counted,  the  articles  of
which do not differ in any significant manner, provided that
no Riba ensues.
3/2/2 Among  the  items  for  which  variations  in  numbers  make  no
difference  are  the  products  of  companies  that  manufacture
goods in approximate units that are identified by trademarks,
standardised  specifications  and  are  regularly  and  commonly
available at any time. However, this rule must be read together
with item 3/2/8.
3/2/3 Salam is not permitted for anything specific like this car. Nor
is  it  permitted  for  anything  for  which  the  seller  may  not  be
held  responsible,  like  land,  buildings  or  trees;  or  for  articles
whose values change according to subjective assessment, like
jewellery and antiques. Also, it is not permissible to stipulate
that  al-Muslam  Fihi  must  be  from  a  specific  piece  of  land.
However, on the delivery date the seller may present the buyer
with  whatever  items  are  available  (and  meet  the  contract
specifications), irrespective of whether such items are from his
own fields or factories or elsewhere.
3/2/4 It  is  not  permissible  for  al-Muslam  Fihi  to  be  an  amount  of
currency, gold or silver, if the capital of the Salam contract was
paid in the form of currency, gold or silver.
274274
Shariah Standard No. (10): Salam and Parallel Salam
3/2/5 Al-Muslam  Fihi  must  be  the  kind  of  article  for  which
a  specification  may  be  drawn  up  so  that  the  seller  may  be
held responsible for its conformity to the specification. It will
be sufficient if the specification is explained in a manner that
removes uncertainty, except for minor discrepancies that are
customarily ignored, considered acceptable, and not usually
regarded as grounds for dispute.
3/2/6 It is a requirement that al-Muslam Fihi be clearly known to the
contracting parties in a manner that eliminates any possibility
of  uncertainty  or  ambiguity.  The  reference  for  determining
descriptions that are used to specify and identify al-Muslam
Fihi is customary practice and the experience of experts.
3/2/7 It is a requirement that the parties know the quantity of al-Mus-
lam Fihi. The quantity of each item is determined according to
its condition and nature with regard to weight, measurement,
volume and number.
3/2/8 It is a requirement that al-Muslam Fihi be commonly available
under normal circumstances at the place where it should be on
the delivery date, so that the commodity will be accessible to
the seller in order to discharge his obligation by delivering it to
the buyer.
3/2/9 It  is  a  requirement  that  the  date  of  delivery  for  al-Muslam
Fihi be known in a manner that eliminates any uncertainty or
ambiguity which may lead to a dispute. There is no Shariah
objection  to  the  contracting  parties  setting  various  dates
objection  to  the  contracting  parties  setting  various  dates  on on
which  the  delivery  of  al-Muslam  Fihi  may  take  place,  in
instalments,  provided  the  capital  of  Salam  was  paid  at  the
time the contract was originally concluded.
3/2/10  In principle, the parties may designate the place at which al-
Muslam Fihi is to be delivered. If the parties to the contract
do not determine the place of delivery, then the place at which
the  contract  was  concluded  will  be  regarded  as  the  place  of
delivery unless it turns out to be impossible to make delivery
275275
Shariah Standard No. (10): Salam and Parallel Salam
to such a place. In that case, the place of delivery should be
determined according to customary practice.
3/3  Security for al-Muslam Fihi
  Al-Muslam Fihi may be secured by a mortgagee or a guarantee or any
other permissible means of securing payment.
4. Changes to al-Muslam Fihi
4/1  Selling al-Muslam Fihi before taking possession
It is not permitted for the buyer to sell al-Muslam Fihi before taking
possession of it.
4/2  Replacement of al-Muslam Fihi
It is permissible for the buyer to exchange al-Muslam Fihi for other
goods, except currency, after the delivery date falls due, as long as
such
goods, except currency, after the delivery date falls due, as long as such
a  substitution  was  not  stipulated  in  the  contract.  This  rule  applies
whether  or  not  the  substitute  is  similar  in  kind  to  al-Muslam  Fihi.
This  is  provided  that  the  substitute  is  suitable  for  being  exchanged
as al-Muslam Fihi for the capital of the Salam contract, and that the
market value of the substitute should not be greater than the market
value of al-Muslam Fihi at the time of delivery.
4/3  Cancellation (Iqalah) of a Salam contract
of a Salam contract
4/3  Cancellation (Iqalah)
It is permissible, when both parties agree, to cancel the entire Salam
contract in return for repayment in full of the amount of the capital
of Salam. Partial cancellation, that is, cancellation of the delivery of
part of al-Muslam Fihi, in return for repayment of a corresponding
part of the capital of Salam, is also permissible.
5. Delivery of al-Muslam Fihi
5/1  The  seller  is  under  an  obligation  to  deliver  al-Muslam  Fihi  to  the
buyer on the due date in accordance with the terms of the contract,
such as agreed specifications and quantity. The buyer, on the other
hand, must accept the goods if they meet the specifications explained
in the contract. If the buyer refuses to accept al-Muslam Fihi, he shall
be compelled to do so.
276276
Shariah Standard No. (10): Salam and Parallel Salam
5/2  If the seller offers delivered goods of a quality that is superior to that
required  by  the  contractual  specifications,  the  buyer  must  accept
the goods, provided that the seller shall not seek a higher price for
the better quality. This may be considered one of the ways in which
a contract is ethically fulfilled. However, this will apply only if the
(inferior) description specified in the contract is not itself deemed
vital.
5/3  If the quality of the delivered goods is inferior to that required by the
contractual specifications, the buyer is entitled either to reject or to
accept the goods in that condition. If he accepts the goods, his action
is considered as ethical acceptance. It is also permissible for the two
parties to agree to a settlement on terms for acceptance of the goods
even at a discounted price.
5/4  It is not permitted for a seller to deliver al-Muslam Fihi in the form of
a commodity different from the one agreed upon if the commodity
is considered to belong to the same genus as al-Muslam Fihi (e.g.,
al-Muslam Fihi is corn and the commodity that the seller wants to
deliver  is  wheat).  However,  the  delivery  of  al-Muslam  Fihi  in  the
form of a different type of commodity from that agreed upon may
take place only on the basis of the conditions for the replacement of
al-Muslam Fihi by other goods. [see item 4/2]
5/5  Delivery of al-Muslam Fihi may take place before the due date, on
condition that the goods conform to the agreed specifications and
quantities. If the buyer has a valid reason for rejecting the goods,
then he will not be compelled to accept them. Otherwise, the buyer
will be forced to accept the goods.
5/6  If the seller fails to perform his obligation, owing to insolvency, he
should be granted an extension of time for delivery.
5/7  It is not permitted to stipulate a penalty clause in respect of delay in
the delivery of al-Muslam Fihi.
5/8  In case all or part of al-Muslam Fihi is not available to the seller on
the due date, the buyer shall have the following options:
277277
Shariah Standard No. (10): Salam and Parallel Salam
5/8/1 To wait until al-Muslam Fihi is available.
5/8/2 To cancel the contract and recover the paid capital.
It is also permissible for the parties to agree to replacement of
al-Muslam Fihi by other goods. [see item 4/2]
6. Parallel Salam
6/1  It is permissible for the seller to enter into a separate, independent
Salam contract with a third party in order to acquire goods of a similar
specification to those specified in the first Salam contract, so that the
first  Salam  obligation  will  be  discharged  by  delivering  these  goods.
Hence, the seller in the first Salam contract becomes the buyer in the
second Salam contract.
6/2  It is permissible for the buyer to conclude a separate parallel Salam
with a third party for the purpose of selling, on the basis of Salam,
a commodity whose description corresponds to the description of
the commodity to be acquired through the first Salam contract. In
this  situation,  the  buyer  in  the  first  Salam  contract  becomes  the
seller in the second Salam contract.
6/3  In both the two situations mentioned in items 6/1 and 6/2, it is not not
6/3  In both the two situations mentioned in items 6/1 and 6/2, it is
permissible  for  the  parties  to  link  the  obligations  under  the  two
Salam  contracts  together  so  that  the  execution  of  the  obligations
of one contract is contingent on the outcome of the other. Hence,
it  is  necessary  that  both  the  obligations  and  the  rights  under  the
two  contracts  stand  alone  in  all  respects.  Therefore,  if  one  party
breaches  his  obligation  under  the  first  Salam  contract,  the  other
party (the injured party) has no right to relate this damage or loss to
the party with whom he concluded a Parallel Salam. Consequently,
he has no right on the basis of his loss or damage under the first
Salam contract to terminate the second Salam contract or to delay
in performing it.
6/4  All the rules of Salam as explained in items 1-5 above are applicable

Wisdom of Making Salam Permissible
The  wisdom  of  making  Salam  permissible  lies  in  the  fact  that  Salam
facilitates a type of financing for people in need of it. In particular, farmers,
market gardeners and merchants, among others, need working capital for
their businesses and for their living expenses in order to operate. Hence,
Salam is made permissible so that these businesses may benefit from it.
The  buyer  may  benefit  from  its  permissibility  as  well,  by  acquiring  the
commodity at a price below the market price.
Similarly, a contract of Salam responds to the needs of a large number
of business enterprises at different levels, ranging from small and medium-
sized  enterprises  to  conglomerates  that  are  involved  in  agricultural  and
industrial production or trade and the like. In order for these businesses
to be productive, they need working capital in the form of either cash or
assets. Hence, Salam has provided an investment opportunity in the form
of financing of the working capital for trade. It also covers the demands of
those in need of liquidity, as long as they are able to fulfill the orders they
receive in return at the due date.
Although the contract of Salam is commonly used by agricultural busi-
nesses, its permissibility is not, however, confined to these fields. It can also
be used in other investment opportunities, such as industry or trade.
The contract of Salam also meets immediate needs for liquidity. This is
because it gives the seller flexibility in using the sale proceeds (before the
commodity is delivered), and the opportunity to arrange for the counter-
value (al-Muslam Fihi) and its delivery to the buyer at the date of delivery.
Subject Matter of a Salam Contract
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  presenting  usufruct  as  capital  in
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  presenting  usufruct  as  capital  in
a Salam contract is the view of the Maliki scholars. This is regarded as
immediate receipt of the capital based on the Shariah maxim that says:

SalamSalam
A Salam transaction is the purchase of a commodity for deferred delivery
in exchange for immediate payment. It is a type of sale in which the price,
known  as  the  Salam  capital,  is  paid  at  the  time  of  contracting  while  the
delivery of the item to be sold, known as al-Muslam Fihi (the subject-matter
of a Salam contract), is deferred. The seller and the buyer are known as al-
respectively. Salam is also
Muslam Ilaihi and al-Muslam or Rab al-Salam respectively. Salam is also
Muslam Ilaihi and al-Muslam or Rab al-Salam
known as Salaf (literally; borrowing).
Parallel Salam
If  the  seller  enters  into  another  separate  Salam  contract  with  a  third
party to acquire goods, the specification of which corresponds to that of
the commodity specified in the first Salam contract, so that he (the seller)
can fulfil his obligation under that contract, then this second contract is
called,  in  contemporary  custom,  Parallel  Salam  or
.  The
Salam  Muwazi.  The
called,  in  contemporary  custom,  Parallel  Salam  or  Salam  Muwazi
following  is  an  example  of  such  a  contract.  An  Institution  on  one  hand
buys a specified quantity of cotton from farmers on a Salam basis and, in
turn, the buyer in the first Salam contract enters into a new separate Salam
contract  with  textile  mills  so  as  to  provide  them,  by  means  of  that  new
Salam contract, with cotton, the specifications of which are similar to the
specifications of the cotton to be acquired under the first Salam contract,
without making the execution of the second Salam contract contingent on
the execution of the first Salam contract.
Iqalah
Iqalah or cancellation of a contract is a bilateral agreement of the contract-
ing parties to abate and remove the legal effect of a contract.

obligations  toward  such  a  third  party,  and  this  prohibition

 The  Arabic  term  Istisnaa  applies  to  both  manufacturing  and  construction,  and
(1)(1) The  Arabic  term  Istisnaa  applies  to  both  manufacturing  and  construction,  and
there is no convenient term in English that covers both manufacturers and builders.
Therefore, the term manufacturer will be used in this standard to designate a party
acting as manufacturer or contractor in an Istisnaa contract, and the term subject-
matter will be used to designate the goods or buildings that are the subject-matter of
the contract.

2/2  Form and conditions of an Istisnaa contract
2/2/1 A  contract  of  Istisnaa  is  binding  on  the  contracting  parties
provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, which include
specification  of  the  type,  kind,  quality  and  quantity  of  the
subject-matter  to  be  produced.  Moreover,  the  price  of  the
subject-matter must be known and, if necessary, the delivery
date  must  be  determined.  If  the  subject-matter  does  not
conform to the specification agreed upon, the customer has
the option to accept or to refuse the subject-matter.
2/2/2 Since a contract of Istisnaa is binding, the parties to the contract
are  inevitably  bound  by  all  obligations  and  consequences
flowing from their agreement. In other words, the contracting
parties need not to renew an exchange of offer and acceptance
after  the  subject-matter  is  completed.  This  is  different  from
the  promise  in  a  contract  of  Murabahah,  which  requires  the
signature of a sale contract through a new offer and acceptance
by the parties when possession of the items to be sold is taken
by the Institution.
2/2/3  It  is  not  permitted  for  the  manufacturer  to  stipulate  in  the
contract of Istisnaa that he is not liable for defects.
2/2/4 It  is  not  permissible  to  conclude  Istisnaa  contracts  or  pro-
cesses of Istisnaa in a manner that makes it a legal device for
a mere interest-based financing. Examples are a transaction in
which the Institution buys items from the contractor on a cash
payment  basis  and  sells  them  back  to  the  manufacturer  on
a deferred payment basis at a higher price; or where the party
ordering the subject-matter to be produced is the manufactur-
er himself; or where one third or more of the facility in which
the subject-matter will be produced belongs to the customer.
All the circumstances mentioned above would make the deal
an interest-based financing deal in which the subject-matter
never genuinely changes hands, even if the deal is won through
competitive  bidding.  This  rule  is  intended  to  avoid  sale  and

3. Subject-Matter of, and Guarantees in, Istisnaa
3/1  The rulings concerning al-Masnoo
3/1/1 An Istisnaa contract is permissible only for raw materials that
can be transformed from their natural state by a manufacturing
or  construction  process  involving  labour.  Therefore,  Istisnaa
is valid only in so far as the supplier has agreed to provide
a subject-matter that is manufactured or constructed.
3/1/2 It  is  permissible  that  a  contract  of  Istisnaa  be  concluded  for
the production of a subject-matter having unique descriptions
according to the requirement of the ultimate purchaser even if
such a subject-matter has no substitutes in the market, provided
the  subject-matter  is  subject  to  specification.  Similarly,  it  is
permissible that the subject-matter of a contract of Istisnaa be
items that have perfect substitutes in the market, and can be
substituted for one another in fulfilling an obligation, because
they share common characteristics by virtue of the process of
manufacture  or  construction.  This  rule  applies  whether  the
items to be produced are intended for consumption or for use
with their substance kept intact.
3/1/3 It  is  not  permissible  that  the  subject-matter  of  an  Istisnaa
contract be an existing and identified capital asset. For example,
it  is  invalid  for  the  Institution  to  conclude  a  contract  to  sell
a particular designated car or factory on the basis of Istisnaa.
This is because Istisnaa is a sale contract applicable to items
that are identified by specification, not by designation. Unless
the  items  are  completely  or  partially  delivered,  the  ultimate
purchaser  has  no  prior  right  (in  the  event  that  the  supplier
is  declared  bankrupt  or  insolvent)  over  a  third  party  to  the
items that are the subject-matter of the contract while they are
still in the process of being produced and have not yet been
delivered to him. In addition, the ultimate purchaser cannot
be regarded as the owner of the materials in the possession of
the  subject-
the  manufacturer  for  the  purpose  of  producing  the  subject-
the  manufacturer  for  the  purpose  of  producing
298298
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
matter of the contract, unless the manufacturer has previously
undertaken, as a guarantee for the completion of the work, that
such materials will only be used for the order of the ultimate
purchaser.
3/1/4 The contract of Istisnaa may be concluded with a condition
that  the  production  shall  be  carried  out  by  the  Institution
using its own resources, in which case it has to abide by this
condition and has no right to assign the process of production
to another entity.
3/1/5 It is permissible for the manufacturer to fulfil his obligation
in an Istisnaa contract by using items produced by his own
resources  or  items  produced  by  other  parties  that  existed
before  the  contract  was  concluded.  The  latter  option  is,
however, only valid if the ultimate purchaser did not stipulate
that the manufacturer should use his own resources. However,
this  rule  should  not  be  used  as  a  device  for  deferment  of
consideration  (the  price  and  the  commodity)  of  a  sale  of
a  subject-matter  that  is  to  be  delivered  in  the  future  based
on its specification as given by the seller, but which are not
intended to be produced.
3/1/6 The manufacturer is under an obligation to produce the sub-
ject-matter  according  to  specification  and  within  the  period
agreed upon or within such reasonable time as the nature of
the  work  may  permit,  in  accordance  with  accepted  practice
that is recognised by experts.
3/1/7 The parties may agree on a period during which the manu-
facturer will be liable for any defects or the maintenance of
the  subject-matter.  They  may  also  leave  the  determination
of liability relating to defects and maintenance to customary
practice.
3/1/8 It is permissible to draw up an Istisnaa contract for real estate
developments on designated land owned either by the ultimate
either of them
purchaser or the contractor, or on land in which either of them
purchaser or the contractor, or on land in which
299299
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
owns  the  usufruct.  This  is  permissible  because  the  contract
involves  the  construction  of  specified  buildings  that  will  be
built  and  sold  according  to  specification  and  the  contract  of
Istisnaa  in  this  case  does  not  concern  a  particular  identified
place (i.e. the land).
3/2  Price and guarantees of Istisnaa contract
3/2/1 It is a requirement that the price for an Istisnaa contract be
known at the conclusion of the contract, in which case it can
be  in  the  form  of  cash  or  tangible  goods  or  the  usufruct  of
an  asset  for  a  particular  duration,  whether  such  usufruct  is
related to an asset other than the subject-matter or to the sub-
ject-matter  itself.  The  use  of  usufruct  of  the  subject-matter
itself  as  consideration  for  an  Istisnaa  contract  is  relevant  to
situations  when  a  government  offers  a  preferential  contract
giving usufruct to the builder or manufacturer for a partic-
ular  duration,  commonly  known  as  Build  Operate  Transfer
(BOT).
3/2/2 The  price  of  an  Istisnaa  contract  may  be  deferred  or  paid
in instalments within a certain period of time, or if delivery
of  the  subject-matter  is  to  be  made  in  stages  a  portion  of
the price may be paid immediately while the balance is paid
by instalments according to the stages of delivery. It is also
permissible to connect payment with the stage of completion
of the work, (such that a payment is made at the end of each
stage), provided the stages of this type of work are by custom
subject to specification and their identification will not lead
to dispute.
3/2/3 If the process of manufacture or construction is divided into
into
3/2/3 If the process of manufacture or construction is divided
phases,  or  payment  is  designed  according  to  the  stage  of
completion of the work, then the manufacturer or contractor
is entitled to request that the ultimate buyer make payment
accordingly for each stage that has been carried out according
to specification.
300300
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
3/2/4 It is permissible that the price of Istisnaa transactions vary in
accordance with variations in delivery date. There is also no
objection to a number of offers being subject to negotiation,
provided  that  eventually  only  one  offer  will  be  chosen  for
concluding the Istisnaa contract. This is to avoid uncertainty
and lack of knowledge that may lead to dispute.
3/2/5 A  contract  of  Istisnaa  cannot  be  drawn  up  on  the  basis  of
a Murabahah sale, for example, by determining the price of
Istisnaa on a cost- plus basis.
3/2/6 If  the  actual  costs  incurred  by  the  Institution  to  bring  the
subject-matter to completion are substantially less than the
estimated costs or the Institution secures a discount from the
party with whom it contracted on a Parallel Istisnaa basis to
acquire  the  subject-matter  in  order  to  fulfil  its  contractual
obligation,  the  Institution  is  not  obliged  to  give  a  discount
to the ultimate purchaser and the latter is not entitled to the
amount  or  part  thereof  the  Institution  has  gained  over  the
estimated costs. The same rule applies conversely when the
actual costs of production are substantially greater than the
estimated costs.
3/3  Guarantees
3/3/1 It is permissible for the Institution, acting either in the capacity
of  the  manufacturer  or  of  the  ultimate  purchaser,  to  give  or
demand accordingly Arboun as a guarantee, which will either
be part of the price, if the contract is fulfilled, or forfeited, if
the  contract  is  rescinded.  However,  it  is  preferable  that  the
amount  forfeited  be  limited  to  an  amount  equivalent  to  the
actual damage suffered.
3/3/2 In  an  Istisnaa  contract,  it  is  permissible  for  the  Institution,
whether acting in the capacity of manufacturer or in the ca-
pacity of the ultimate purchaser, to demand guarantees that
it considers sufficient to secure fulfilment of its rights against
301301
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
an ultimate purchaser or a manufacturer. It is also permissible
for the institution, when acting in the capacity of an ultimate
purchaser, to give guarantees requested by the manufacturer,
which can be in a form of a mortgage, personal guarantee,
assignment of rights, a current account, or an investment ac-
count or consent to blocking withdrawal from an account.
4. Changes to Istisnaa Contract
4/1  Amendments, changes and introduction of new conditions
4/1/1 It is permissible, after the conclusion of an Istisnaa contract,
for  the  manufacturer  and  the  ultimate  purchaser  to  agree  on
amending  the  manufacturing  or  construction  specifications
previously agreed upon or introducing additional specification
accordingly
requirements on condition that the price is adjusted accordingly
requirements on condition that the price is adjusted
and a reasonable period for the execution of the new requirements
is granted. It is also permissible to state in the contract that the
consideration  for  amendments  or  introduction  of  additional
requirements  shall  be  determined  and  added  to  the  original
price as per the expert opinion, custom or an identified price
index which preclude any uncertainty that may potentially lead
to dispute.
4/1/2 The  ultimate  purchaser  cannot  oblige  the  manufacturer  to
introduce modifications and changes to the subject matter of
an Istisnaa contract without the consent of the manufacturer.
4/1/3  It is not permissible for amendments and changes to the contract
to be agreed on the basis that an additional sum will be paid
in  consideration  for  an  extension  of  the  period  of  payment.
However, a rebate for pre-payment is permissible provided it is
not stipulated at the conclusion of the contract.
4/2  Intervening contingencies (force majeure)
4/2/1 It is permissible, by way of agreement of the contracting parties
price
or arbitration or judicial procedure, to amend the contract price
or arbitration or judicial procedure, to amend the contract
302302
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
of  an  Istisnaa  contract  upwards  or  downwards,
as  a  result  of
of  an  Istisnaa  contract  upwards  or  downwards,  as  a  result  of
intervening  contingencies  (force  majeure).  This  rule  must  be
read together with item 4/1/3 above.
4/2/2 It is permissible for the Institution to replace a contractor and
enter  into  an  Istisnaa  contract  with  a  customer  to  complete
a project which had been started by the previous contractor
of such a customer. In this case, an assessment of the project
should  be  undertaken  on  the  basis  of  the  existing  status  of
the  project.  The  cost  of  this  assessment  is  chargeable  to  the
account of the customer, in which case all outstanding debts,
if any, that arise from the incomplete Istisnaa contract shall be
the personal responsibility of the customer. The parties may
after this conclude a new Istisnaa contract for the remaining
work. The Institution is not bound to deal with the previous
contractor.  Rather,  the  Institution  has  the  right  to  stipulate
that the work needed to complete the project will be carried
out by any means it deems fit.
4/2/3 In the case of constructing buildings or public utilities on land
owned by the ultimate purchaser, it is permissible to stipulate
that the ultimate purchaser has the right to perform the contract
of  Istisnaa  at  the  expense  of  the  manufacturer  if  the  latter
fails  to  perform  the  contract  or  to  complete  the  work  within
a particular period of time, and that this performance will be
effected from the date the manufacturer halted the work.
4/2/4  If the contractor is unable to continue to discharge his obligation,
obligation,
4/2/4  If the contractor is unable to continue to discharge his
the ultimate purchaser (the owner of the land) is not entitled
to acquire ownership of the incomplete building structures or
utilities that are already in place without giving consideration
to the contractor. However, this rule depends on the cause of
the failure to continue the work. If the failure to perform is due
to the misconduct of the contractor, the ultimate purchaser is
liable only for the value of the building structure and the builder
for  any  actual
is  liable  to  compensate  the  ultimate  purchaser  for  any  actual
is  liable  to  compensate  the  ultimate  purchaser
303303
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
damage or loss he suffered. If the failure to perform is due to the
misconduct of the ultimate purchaser, the contractor is entitled
to the value of the work he has completed and compensation for
any damage or loss. However, if the failure to perform has not
been caused by either of them, the ultimate purchaser is liable
only for the value of the building structure that is already in place
and neither of them has any responsibility to pay compensation
for the loss or damage the other party had suffered. [see item
4/2/3]
4/2/5 It is permissible that a contract of Istisnaa includes a clause to
the effect that if any additional conditions are inserted into the
contract at a later date as a result of directives of the relevant
authorities,  and  these  additional  conditions  lead  to  extra
expenses that cannot, by virtue of the terms of the contract,
be  borne  by  the  manufacturer  because  they  were  not  in  the
original  contract  as  signed  or  there  is  no  law  making  such
payment compulsory, the extra expenses will be borne by the
ultimate purchaser.
5. Supervision of the Execution of an Istisnaa Contract
5/1  It is permissible for the seller and purchaser to appoint technically
experienced consulting firm to represent it in determining whether
the subject-matter conforms to the contractual specification, and to
advise the Institution as to whether payment for the subject-matter,
or  delivery  or  acceptance  of  it,  under  the  terms  of  the  contract,
should take place, and they should adhere to its resolutions
5/2  It is permissible for the Institution, when acting as the manufacturer,
to draw-up an independent and separate contract of agency appoint-
ing the ultimate purchaser as an agent of the Institution to supervise
the manufacturing or construction process so as to ensure that the
items produced conform to contractual specification.
5/3  It is permissible for the manufacturer and the ultimate purchaser to
agree on the party who will bear the additional costs of supervision
of an Istisnaa contract.
304304
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
6. Delivery and Disposal of the Subject-Matter
6/1  The manufacturer is discharged from liability if the subject-matter is
delivered to either the ultimate purchaser or to a person appointed
by him or if the ultimate purchaser is enabled to exercise full control
over the subject-matter.
6/1/1 If  the  condition  of  the  subject-matter  does  not  conform  to
the  contractual  specifications  at  the  date  of  delivery,  the
purchaser has the right to reject the subject-matter or
ultimate purchaser has the right to reject the subject-matter or
ultimate
to accept it in its present condition, in which case the acceptance
constitutes
satisfactory  performance  of  the  contract.  It  is  also
constitutes  satisfactory  performance  of  the  contract.  It  is  also
contracting parties to agree on acceptance
permissible for the contracting parties to agree on acceptance
permissible for the
of a subject-matter that fails to conform to the specification
even if such an arrangement involves a price discount.
6/1/2 If the seller offers to deliver a better quality, then the purchaser
shall accept his conditions, provided that the seller shall not
charge  any  additional  amounts  for  the  better  quality,  which
may  be  considered  one  of  the  ways  in  which  a  contract  is
ethically fulfilled, unless the quality specified in the contract is
particularly pursued by the purchaser.
6/2  It  is  permissible  that  delivery  of  the  subject-matter  takes  place
before the due date, on condition that the subject-matter meets the
specifications agreed upon, in which case the ultimate purchaser
is  obliged  to  accept  the  subject-matter.  If  the  ultimate  purchaser
is unwilling to take delivery of the subject-matter, the rule on this
point depends on whether or not there is justification for this refusal.
If there is a good reason for the rejection of the subject-matter, the
ultimate purchaser shall not be obliged to accept it. If there is not
a good reason for rejecting it, then the ultimate purchaser will be
obliged to accept the subject-matter.
6/3  The delivery of the subject-matter may take place through constructive
possession,  by  enabling  the  ultimate  purchaser  to  take  control  over
the subject-matter after the production process is completed. At this
305305
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
point, the liability of the manufacturer in respect of the subject-matter
comes to an end and the liability of the ultimate purchaser begins. If
after enabling the ultimate purchaser to take control over the subject-
matter any loss or damage subsequently occurs to the subject-matter
without  any  proof  of  negligence  or  misconduct  on  the  part  of  the
manufacturer, then the ultimate purchaser is liable. This is therefore
the  demarcation  line  between  the  liabilities  of  the  two  parties:  the
liability of the manufacturer and the liability of the ultimate purchaser.
6/4  If the ultimate purchaser refuses to accept the subject-matter without
a good reason after he is enabled to take possession, the subject-matter
will remain in the possession of the manufacturer on a trust basis, in
which case the manufacturer will not be liable for loss or damage that
occurs  to  it,  unless  such  loss  or  damage  is  a  result  of  negligence  or
misconduct on the part of the manufacturer. The ultimate purchaser
bears the expenses for the safe keeping of the subject-matter.
6/5  It is permissible to state in a contract of Istisnaa that the manufacturer
will  act  as  the  agent  of  the  ultimate  purchaser  to  sell  the  subject-
matter  if  there  is  a  delay  on  the  part  of  the  purchaser  in  taking
delivery  of  the  subject-matter  within  a  particular  period  of  time.
In this case, the manufacturer will sell the subject-matter on behalf
of the ultimate purchaser and, after deducting the agreed contract
price,  the  balance,  if  any,  will  be  returned  to  the  purchaser.  If  the
price obtained is less than the contract price, the manufacturer shall
have a right of recourse to the ultimate purchaser for the recovery of
the remaining balance. In addition, the ultimate purchaser will bear
the expenses incurred in selling the subject-matter.
6/6  It is permissible for the contract of Istisnaa to include a fair penalty
clause stipulating an agreed amount of money for compensating the
ultimate purchaser adequately if the manufacturer is late in delivering
the subject-matter. Such compensation is permissible only if the delay
is not caused by intervening contingencies (force majeure). However,
it is not permitted to stipulate a penalty clause against the ultimate
purchaser  for  default  on  payment.  [see  item  2/1/2  of  the  Shariah
Standard No. (3) on Procrastinating Debtor]
306306
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
6/7  It is not permissible to sell the subject-matter prior to taking either
actual or constructive possession of it [see item 6/4]. However, it is
permissible to conclude an Istisnaa contract to sell an item on the
basis of description or specification that is similar to an item to be
Istisnaa  Muwazi: :
acquired  from  a  manufacturer,  and  this  is  called  Istisnaa  Muwazi
acquired  from  a  manufacturer,  and  this  is  called
Parallel Istisnaa [see item 7].
6/8  It is permissible for the Institution acting in the capacity of ultimate
purchaser to appoint, after taking possession of the subject-matter,
the  manufacturer  as  an  agent  to  sell  the  subject-matter  to  latters
customers  on  behalf  of  the  Institution.  This  agency  is  permissible
whether it is carried out free of charge, or for consideration either
in the form of a fixed fee or a particular percentage of the sale price,
on condition that the contract of agency and the contract of Istisnaa
were not entered into in connection with each other.
7. Parallel Istisnaa
7/1  It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution  to  buy  items  on  the  basis  of
a  clear  and  unambiguous  specification  and  to  pay,  with  the  aim
of providing liquidity to the manufacturer, the price in cash when
the contract is concluded. Subsequently, the Institution may enter
into a contract with another party in order to sell, in the capacity
of  manufacturer  or  supplier,  items  whose  specification  conforms
to the wishes of that other party, on the basis of parallel Istisnaa,
and fulfil its contractual obligation accordingly. This is permissible
on condition that the delivery date stipulated in the parallel (sale)
contract must not precede that stipulated in the original purchase
contract, and, moreover, the two contracts should remain separate
from each other. [see item 3/1/4]
7/2  It  is  permissible  for  the  Institution,  acting  in  the  capacity  of  the
producer or supplier, to conclude an Istisnaa contract with the aim of
selling such items to the customer on a deferred payment basis, and
to enter into a Parallel Istisnaa contract on an immediate payment
basis with a manufacturer or builder to acquire such items as per the
specifications in the first contract and sell them to the customer. This This
specifications in the first contract and sell them to the customer.
307307
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
is  permissible  on  condition  that  the  two  contracts  should  remain
separate  and,  moreover,  be  subject  to  the  matters  set  out  in  item
3/1/4.
7/3  As  a  result  of  concluding  an  Istisnaa  contract  in  the  capacity  of
a  producer  or  supplier,  the  Institution  must  assume  liability  for
ownership  risk  and  maintenance  and  insurance  expenses  prior  to
delivering the subject-matter to the ultimate purchaser (the
customer).
delivering the subject-matter to the ultimate purchaser (the customer).
Moreover, the Institution is not permitted, in the Parallel Istisnaa
contract concluded with the manufacturer, to transfer to the latter
the risk arising from its obligations towards the customer.
7/4 It  is  not  permissible  to  make  any  contractual  link  between  the
obligations  under  two  contracts  (the  contract  of  Istisnaa  and  the
contract  of  Parallel  Istisnaa)  when  they  are  concluded.  Therefore,
it is also not permissible for a party to an ordinary Istisnaa contract
(I)  to  withdraw  his  contractual  obligations  or  delay  delivering  the
subject-matter of the contract because the obligation under Parallel
Istisnaa did not take place or (II) to increase the price of the goods
to  be  delivered  because  of  an  increase  in  the  cost  of  goods  in  the
Parallel Istisnaa. However, there is no restriction on the right of the
Parallel Istisnaa. However, there is no restriction on the right of
the
concluding
Institution to stipulate conditions and requirements when concluding
Institution to stipulate conditions and requirements when
a Parallel Istisnaa contract as a purchaser, including a penalty clause
similar to, or different from, that which the customer has stipulated
in the first Istisnaa contract in which the Institution is the supplier.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
In its meeting No. (5) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 8-12 Ramadan
1421 A.H. corresponding to 4-8 December, 2000 A.D., the Shariah Board
decided to give priority to the preparation of the a Shariah rules for Istisnaa
and Parallel Istisnaa.
On Monday 11 Shawwal 1420 A.H. corresponding to 17 January 2000
A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee recommended to the Shariah
Board the commissioning of a Shariah consultant to prepare a juristic study
and an exposure draft on the Shariah Rules for Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa.
In its meeting held in Bahrain on 21-23 Muharram 1421 A.H., corre-
sponding to 26-28 April 2000 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee
discussed the exposure draft of the Shariah Rules for Istisnaa and Parallel
Istisnaa  and  asked  the  consultant  to  make  amendments  in  light  of  the
comments made by the members.
In its meeting No. (4) held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on 14
Shaban 1421 A.H. corresponding to 10 November 2000 A.D., the Fatwa
and Arbitration Committee discussed the exposure draft and made some
relevant amendments.
The revised exposure draft of the Shariah Rules was presented to the
Shariah  Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (5)  held  in  Makkah  Al-Mukarramah
on 8-12 Ramadan 1421 A.H. corresponding to 4-8 December 2000 A.D.
The  Shariah  Board  made  further  amendments  to  the  exposure  draft  of
the  standard  and  decided  that  it  should  be  distributed  to  specialists  and
interested  parties  to  obtain  their  comments  in  order  to  discuss  them  in
a public hearing.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Legitimacy of Istisnaa Contract
The legitimacy of Istisnaa is based on the request of the Prophet (peace
be upon him) that a pulpit (a platform) for preaching and a finger ring
be  manufactured  for  him.
  An  Istisnaa  contract  is  also  permissible  on
be  manufactured  for  him.(2)(2)  An  Istisnaa  contract  is  also  permissible  on
the  basis  of  the  principle  of  Istihsan  (Shariah  approbation),  the  general
principles of contracts and transactions and the objectives of Shariah. The
Istisnaa is a binding contract and not a mere promise. The International
Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in support of the legitimacy
of Istisnaa.(3)(3)
of Istisnaa.
Istisnaa Contract
  The basis for it not being permissible that the role of the Institution
The basis for it not being permissible that the role of the Institution
remain as a mere financier for a deal concluded between the supplier
and the ultimate purchaser is that this would lead to involvement in
a Riba transaction which makes the Istisnaa contract a mere cover-up
and not a real Istisnaa.
The basis for stating that an Istisnaa contract is binding is the view of

  The basis for the impermissibility of the manufacturer including a defect
The basis for the impermissibility of the manufacturer including a defect
exclusion clause in an Istisnaa contract is that a valid Istisnaa is a sale
of specified goods to be delivered in the future and exclusion of liability
as to defects is valid only in the sale of particular identified goods. This
prohibition of excluding liability as to defects in Istisnaa is one feature
that makes it different from an ordinary sale.
  The basis for the impermissibility of drawing up Istisnaa contracts or
The basis for the impermissibility of drawing up Istisnaa contracts or
procedures in a way that appears to be a mere interest-based financing
is the need to avoid involvement in a Riba transaction, a potential Riba
or Inah sales.
Subject Matter of, and Guarantees in, an Istisnaa Contract
  The basis for the impermissibility of concluding an Istisnaa contract
The basis for the impermissibility of concluding an Istisnaa contract
for items that are not manufactured or constructed is that items that
are not the subject of transformation by manufacture or construction
by man, that is natural things such as animals, fruits and vegetables,
are not by definition covered by the term Istisnaa which means a sale
of materials on condition that they be subjected to transformation by
a manufacturing or construction process.
  The basis for the permissibility of concluding an Istisnaa for manufac-
The basis for the permissibility of concluding an Istisnaa for manufac-
tured items that either have or do not have equivalents in the market
is  because  it  is  normal  for  people  to  deal  in  these  kinds  of  item.  As
a principle, rules that are based on customary practice will change whe-
never such customary practice is changed. Therefore, any customary
transaction that is subject to specifications may be a subject-matter of
Istisnaa, regardless of whether it is for use or consumption.
  The basis for not allowing the subject-matter of Istisnaa to be a specific
The basis for not allowing the subject-matter of Istisnaa to be a specific
identified  item  is  that  an  Istisnaa  contract  involves  a  sale  for  future
delivery based on a specification. Therefore, if the items to be sold are
specific  identified  items,  the  transaction  involves  selling  identified
items that the seller does not own, which is prohibited by the saying
Do not sell what you own not.(4)(4)

Again, items to be manufactured or constructed do not yet exist and
thus cannot be specific and identified. The non-existent item is to be
produced  and  delivered  later  and  this  constitutes  a  non-monetary
obligation of the supplier.(5)(5)
obligation of the supplier.
The basis for the permissibility of a stipulation by the ultimate purchaser
  The basis for the permissibility of a stipulation by the ultimate purchaser
that the manufacture be carried out by the Institution itself is because
this  stipulation  does  affect  the  purpose  of  the  contract.  Rather,  this
condition  is  relevant  in  this  contract  because  the  ultimate  purchaser
may be interested in the items that are produced by a particular supplier
due  to  this  suppliers  distinguished  competence  in  manufacturing  or
construction and the quality of the items manufactured or constructed
by this supplier.
  The basis for the permissibility of the manufacturer presenting to the
The basis for the permissibility of the manufacturer presenting to the
ultimate purchaser either what he has produced or what other parties
have produced, if the ultimate purchaser did not stipulate to the contrary,
is  because  this  satisfies  the  purpose  of  the  contract.  This  is  the  case
because  the  items  are  being  delivered  according  to  the  specifications
that are laid down in the contract.
  The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a time-period during which
The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a time-period during which
manufacturer remains liable for any manufacturing or construction
defects is that such a stipulation serves the purpose of the contract. This
is because the ultimate purchaser wants to use the subject-matter and
this is not possible unless the subject-matter is free from defects.
The basis for the requirement that the price be known is to remove any
  The basis for the requirement that the price be known is to remove any
lack of knowledge and uncertainty that may lead to dispute.
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  in  Istisnaa  of  payment  on  deferred
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  in  Istisnaa  of  payment  on  deferred
terms or on an instalment basis is that labour (i.e. transformation and
added value) is an important part of the items to be sold and this makes
the transaction similar to a leasing contract in which it is permissible
for the rentals to be paid on a deferred or instalment basis without this
being  considered  as  a  sale  of  debt  for  debt  which  is  prohibited.  The
same ruling applies to Istisnaa.

  The basis for the permissibility of offering a difference in the price for
The basis for the permissibility of offering a difference in the price for
an Istisnaa contract relating to a difference in the date of delivery is
that Istisnaa is analogous to an Ijarah contract. The fuqaha have stated
that it is permissible to give a labourer in Ijarah an option regarding
wages depending on whether the worker finishes the work in one day
or in two days. The hirer may say two dinars if the worker finishes in
one day or one dinar if he finishes in two days. Istisnaa is similar to
this. There is a resolution issued during the Al Baraka Annual Forum
supporting this ruling.(6)(6)
supporting this ruling.
  The basis for not allowing a contract of Istisnaa to be drawn up on the
The basis for not allowing a contract of Istisnaa to be drawn up on the
basis  of  a  Murabahah  sale,  for  example,  by  determining  the  price  of
Istisnaa on a cost- plus basis, is because the subject-matter of Murabahah
should be something already in existence, the cost of which is known
and  which  is  owned  prior  to  the  conclusion  of  a  Murabahah  sale.
An Istisnaa contract, on the other hand, is concluded prior to ownership
of  the  subject-matter,  because  (I)  it  is  a  sale  based  on  a  specification
giving rise to a future obligation, and (II) the actual cost will be known
only after the completion of the work, and, (III) the price in a contract of
Istisnaa should be known when the contract is concluded.
  The  basis  for  deciding  that  the  Institution  is  not  obliged  to  give
The  basis  for  deciding  that  the  Institution  is  not  obliged  to  give
a  discount  when  the  actual  costs  of  the  manufacture  are  substantially
greater  than  the  estimated  costs  or  when  it  secures  a  discount  from
the manufacturer is because the Istisnaa contract and Parallel Istisnaa
contract are independent in terms of obligation and effects. The Shariah
Supervisory Board of the Kuwait Finance House has issued a Fatwa in
this respect.(7)(7)
this respect.
  The basis for the permissibility of the Institution acquiring all necessary
The basis for the permissibility of the Institution acquiring all necessary
guarantees  is  that  these  guarantees  secure  its  rights  and  this  request
does affect the purpose of a contract.

The ultimate purchaser (the owner of the land) is not entitled to acquire
ownership of incomplete building structures or utilities that are already
in  place  without  giving  consideration  to  the  builder  if  the  builder  is
unable to continue to discharge his obligation. The basis for this is that
the construction was initiated by the builder at the request of the ultimate
purchaser and such a request is stronger than a mere permission to build
on the latters land.

The basis for the permissibility of a contract of Istisnaa including a clause
that  the  manufacturer  is  not  liable  for  extra  expenses  that  result  from
additional conditions inserted into the contract at a later date as a result
of directives of the relevant authorities, is because this condition is agreed
upon by the parties and does not affect the purpose of Istisnaa contract.

a Fatwa in respect to this ruling.
   The basis for the permissibility of a penalty clause in an Istisnaa contract
The basis for the permissibility of a penalty clause in an Istisnaa contract
is that such a clause is in the interest of the contract and because it is laid
down in respect to an obligation regarding items that must be produced
and delivered in the future and not in respect to monetary debt.
Supervision of the Execution of an Istisnaa Contract
The basis for the permissibility for the Institution, when acting as the
ultimate purchaser, to appoint a technically experienced consulting firm and
the permissibility for the Institution, when acting as the manufacturer, to
appoint the ultimate purchaser as an agent is because agency is permissible
and there is nothing against it in an Istisnaa contract provided it is done
with the agreement of the parties.

Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
Delivery and Disposal of the Subject-Matter
The basis for the impermissibility of selling the items to be produced
prior to taking either actual or constructive possession of them is that such
an action is considered as selling a non-existent item. It is also considered
as selling what one does not own because it is not available for the seller at
the time of conclusion of the contract.
Parallel Istisnaa
The basis for the permissibility of the Institution entering into a contract
with another party in order to sell, in the capacity of manufacturer, builder
or supplier, items whose specification conforms to the wishes of that other
party, on the basis of Parallel Istisnaa, is that in such a case there are two
separate deals of Istisnaa. There is no link between the two contracts; hence,
this is not an instance of two sales in one deal, which is impermissible. The
separation of the two contracts also has the effect of making the transaction
a type of non-Riba-based financing.
318318
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
Appendix (C)
Definitions
Istisnaa Contract
Istisnaa is a contract of sale of specified items to be manufactured or
constructed, with an obligation on the part of the manufacturer or builder
(contractor) to deliver them to the customer upon completion.
Parallel Istaisnaa
Another form of Istisnaa, known in modern custom as Parallel Istisnaa
,  takes  effect  through  two  separate  contracts.  In
al-Istisnaa  al-Muwazi,  takes  effect  through  two  separate  contracts.  In
al-Istisnaa  al-Muwazi
the  first  contract,  the  Islamic  Financial  Institution  acts  in  the  capacity
of a manufacturer, builder or supplier and concludes a contract with the
customer. In the second contract, the Institution acts in the capacity of
a purchaser and concludes another contract with a manufacturer, builder or
supplier in order to fulfil its contractual obligations towards the customer in
the first contract. By this process, a profit is realised through the difference in
price between the two contracts and, in most cases, one of the two contracts
is  concluded  immediately,  (i.e.  the  Istisnaa  contract  entered  into  with  the
manufacturer, builder or supplier), while the second contract (i.e. the contract
entered into with the customer) is concluded later.
Difference Between Istisnaa and Ijarah
The contract of Istisnaa differs from the contract of Ijarah in the sense
that the latter is a contract of services without any commitment to supply
materials  whereas  the  former  requires  that  the  manufacturer  or  builder
provide both services for the transformation or construction process and
ultimately to supply the materials in the form of the finished items.
Difference Between Istisnaa and a Standard Construction Contract
The contract of Istisnaa also differs from a standard construction contract
 providing
in that the latter is regarded as an Ijarah contract if it is confined to providing
in that the latter is regarded as an Ijarah contract if it is confined to
319319
Shariah Standard No. (11): Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa
services only, with the materials to be provided by the customer (the person
who  engaged  the  Institution  to  carry  out  the  construction  work).  But  if
a construction contract requires the builder to provide both the services and
the materials needed to fulfil the contract, then it is an Istisnaa contract.
Difference Between Istisnaa and Salam
The Istisnaa contract also differs from a Salam contract in the sense that
the former is a contract that involves a sale of specified items that have by
nature to be manufactured or constructed. In other words, an Istisnaa contract
is applicable to materials that require transformation by a manufacturing or
construction process. The Salam, on the other hand, is a contract of sale of
specified goods, the permissibility of which is not attached to a condition that
the goods must be manufactured or constructed.

Preface
The objective of this standard is to explain the basis and general rulings
for  Sharikat  al-Aqd,  (contractual  partnership)  which  is  known  today  as
Musharakah, including the rulings for joint partnership, reputation (cred-
itworthiness) partnership, vocation partnership, diminishing partnership
and modern corporations. The explanation of these partnerships includes
definitions,  rulings  applicable  to  each  partnership  and  the  Shariah  lim-
itations that must be taken into account by Islamic financial Institutions

Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers all forms of traditional Fiqh-nominate partnerships
that operate on the basis of Sharikat al-Aqd (contractual partnership),
except  the  partnerships  that  are  explicitly  excluded  by  this  standard
as  indicated  below.  The  standard  also  applies  to  all  modern  forms  of
partnerships including diminishing Musharakah. The standard does not
cover ownership partnership where the parties jointly own an asset. It
does not include rules for Sharikat al-Mufawadah because the practical
application of this form of partnership is rare and, if need be, reference
should be made to Fiqh books. The standard does not cover Mudarabah,
because  this  form  of  partnership  has  a  separate  standard.  In  the  same
vein,  it  does  not  cover  sharecropping  partnerships,  such  as  irrigation
and agricultural partnerships. The standard also does not cover, as far as
modern partnerships are concerned, regulatory policies and procedures
necessary for operations in the market.
2. Definition, Classifications and Types of Sharikat al-Aqd
2/1  Definition of Sharikat al-Aqd

3. First Category: Traditional Fiqh-Nominate Partnerships
3/1  General rulings for Sharikah, especially Sharikat al-Inan
Sharikat al-Inan is a partnership between two or more parties whereby
each partner contributes a specific amount of money in a manner that
gives each one a right to deal in the assets of the partnership, on condition
that  the  profit  is  distributed  according  to  the  partnership  agreement
and  that  the  losses  are  borne  in  accordance  with  the  contribution  of
each partner to the capital.
3/1/1 Conclusion of a Sharikah contract
3/1/1/1 A Sharikah contract can be concluded by agreement
between the parties concerned on the basis of offer
and acceptance. The contract of partnership should,
if necessary, be documented and registered officially.
The objectives of the partnership must be clearly spelt
out in the document of partnership or in the articles
of association of the company.
3/1/1/2  It is permissible for the Institution to enter into a part-
nership  contract  with  non-Muslims  or  conventional
banks  to  carry  out  operations  acceptable  by  Shariah
327327
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
unless it has become evident that the funds or items
presented by these entities for the purpose of the part-
nership are from non-permissible sources. In operating
a partnership with non-Muslims or conventional
banks,
a partnership with non-Muslims or conventional banks,
arrangements  must  be  made  to  obtain  all  necessary
assurances  and  guarantees  that  rules  and  principles
of the Shariah are observed during operations of the
partnership.  Among  such  guarantees  is  one  to  the
effect  that  the  operations  of  the  company  be  either
managed or supervised by an entity that observes the
Shariah rules.
3/1/1/3  It is permissible for the Institutions to include con-
ventional banks as partners in a syndicated financing
which operates on the basis of Shariah, provided that
the Institution secures the right to manage the partner-
ships operations and that such operations are subject
to the Shariah supervision. [see Shariah Standard No.
(24) on Syndicated Financing]
3/1/1/4  It is permissible for the partners to amend at any point
of time the terms of a partnership contract. They may
make  changes  to  the  ratio  of  profit-sharing,  taking
into account that any losses are shared according to
the share of each partner in the partnership capital.
3/1/2 The capital of Sharikah
3/1/2/1  In  principle,  the  capital  of  Sharikah  should  be  con-
tributed  in  the  form  of  monetary  assets  on  which
one can rely in order to determine the amount of the
capital and to recognise profit or loss. Nevertheless, it
is permissible, with the agreement of all partners, to
provide tangible assets (commodities) as the capital
of Sharikah after the monetary values of these assets
are determined and expressed in currency in order to
know the share contributed by each partner.
328328
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
3/1/2/2  If partners have contributed their partnership cap-
ital  in  different  currencies,  these  currencies  must
be  translated  into  the  currency  of  the  Sharikah  at
current exchange rates so as to determine the shares
and liabilities of each partner.
3/1/2/3  The  share  of  each  partner  in  the  capital  should  be
determined,  whether  it  is  contributed  in  the  form
of one lump sum or by more than one payment over
time; i.e., when there is a need for additional funds to
increase the capital.
3/1/2/4  It is not permitted that debts (receivables) alone be
used as a contribution to the Sharikah capital. However,
debts may form part of the contribution to the capital
where they become inseparable from other assets that
can  be  presented  as  a  contribution  to  the  capital  in
Sharikah, such as when a manufacturing firm use its
net assets as a contribution to the capital. [see Shariah
Standard No. (21) on Financial Paper]
3/1/2/5  The  funds  of  current  accounts,  although  they  are
juristically  classified  as  loans  to  the  Institutions,
can be presented as a contribution to the capital in
a Sharikah either with the Institution itself or with
a third party.
3/1/3 Managing a Sharikah venture
3/1/3/1  In principle, each partner is entitled to act in the interest
of the partnership in the following transactions: spot
or deferred sales; taking possession or custody of the
partnership receivables; making payments or deposits
and providing or receiving a mortgage on behalf of the
partnership;  asking  for  payment  of  debts,  admission
of  liabilities,  taking  up  legal  actions,  cancellation
of  liabilities,  taking  up  legal  actions,  cancellation  of of
contracts, rejecting defective goods, renting the assets
and
of  the  partnership,  processing  transfers  of  rights  and
of  the  partnership,  processing  transfers  of  rights
329329
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
debts;  requesting  credit  facilities  in  the  interest  of
partnership;  and  doing  what  is  customary  in  the
interest  of  trading.  A  partner  is  not  entitled  to  act
against the interest of the partnership or to perform
actions that will damage the partnership, such as
giving
actions that will damage the partnership, such as giving
out  grants  or  loans,  unless  all  the  partners  have
consented  to  such  an  action.  However,  the  partner
may  give  out  short-term  minor  loans  that  will  not,
according to customary practice, affect the operation
of partnership.
3/1/3/2  It  is  permissible  for  the  partners  to  agree  that  the
management of the partnership will be restricted to
certain partners or to a single partner. In this case, the
other  partners  are  bound  to  abide  by  their  consent
not to act on behalf of the partnership.
3/1/3/3  It is permissible for the partners to appoint a manager
other than one of the partners and pay him a fixed
remuneration that will be included in the expenses of
the Sharikah. It is also permissible that the partners
set aside a portion of the investment profit plus a fixed
remuneration as a form of incentive for the manager.
However, if the management is carried out from the
outset  for  a  percentage  share  in  the  profit  earned,
this action classifies the manager as a Mudarib and
he is only entitled to a share in the profit, if any, and
deserves  no  further  remuneration  for  management
services.
3/1/3/4  It is not permitted, in a Sharikah contract, to specify
a fixed remuneration for a partner who contributes in
managing the Sharikah funds or provides some form
of other services, such as accounting. However, it is
permissible to give him a greater share of profit than
he would receive solely on the basis of his share in the
partnership capital.
330330
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
3/1/3/5 It is permissible that one of the partners be appointed
to provide services that are mentioned in item 3/1/3/4
provided that the appointment is based on an inde-
pendent contract from the Sharikah contract so that
he may be dismissed as a manager at any point of time
without the need to amend or to terminate the Shari-
kah contract. In this case, the appointed partner may
earn a specific remuneration.
3/1/4 Guarantees in a Sharikah contract
3/1/4/1  All partners in a Sharikah contract maintain the assets
of the Sharikah on a trust basis. Therefore, no one is
liable except in cases of misconduct, negligence or
breach of contract. It is not permitted to stipulate that
a partner in a Sharikah contract guarantees the capital
of another partner.
3/1/4/2  It is permissible for a partner in a Sharikah contract
to stipulate that another partner provides a personal
guarantee or a mortgage to cover cases of misconduct,
negligence or breach of contract.
3/1/4/3  A third party may provide a guarantee to make up
a loss of capital of some or all partners. This guar-
antee  is  circumscribed  with  the  conditions  that
(I) the legal capacity and financial liability of such
a  third  party  as  a  guarantor  are  independent  from
the  Sharikah  contract,  (II)  the  guarantee  should
neither be provided for consideration nor linked in
any manner to the Sharikah contract; (III) the third
party guarantor should not own more than a half of
the capital in the entity to be guaranteed, and (IV)
the  guaranteed  entity  should  not  own  more  than
a half of the capital in the entity that undertakes to
provide a guarantee. In case of a third partys under-
taking to guarantee, the partner benefiting from such
331331
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
an  undertaking  is  not,  however,  entitled  either  to
claim that the Sharikah contract becomes null and
void or to refuse to meet his obligations under the
contract  if  the  guarantor  fails  to  meet  his  volun-
tary promise to cover the loss of his capital, on the
grounds  that  he  (the  beneficiary)  entered  into  the
Sharikah  contract  taking  into  account  the  state  of
such  a  third  partys  undertaking  to  guarantee  the
loss of his capital.
3/1/5 The outcome of Sharikah investments (profit and loss)
3/1/5/1  The Sharikah contract should incorporate a provision
specifying the manner of sharing profits between the
parties.  The  allocation  of  profits  must  be  made  in
a manner that gives each partner an undivided per-
centage of profit, not a sum of money or a percentage
of the capital. [see item 3/1/5/9]
3/1/5/2  It is not permitted to defer the determination of the
profit percentages due to each partner until the re-
alisation  of  profit.  The  profit  percentage  for  each
partner  must  be  determined  at  the  conclusion  of
Sharikah contract. The parties may bilaterally agree
to  amend  the  percentages  of  profit-sharing  on  the
date of distribution. Also, a partner may relinquish,
on the date of distribution, a part of the profit that is
due to him in favour of another party.
3/1/5/3  In principle, the shares of profit may be in proportion
to  the  percentage  of  each  partners  contribution  to
the Sharikah capital. Nevertheless, the partners may
agree  to  make  profit-sharing  not  proportionate  to
their contributions to capital, provided the additional
percentage of profit over the percentage of contribution
to the capital is not in favour of a sleeping partner. If
a  partner  did  not  stipulate  a  condition  that  he  be
332332
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
a  sleeping  partner,  then  he  is  entitled  to  stipulate
an  additional  profit  share  over  his  percentage  of
contribution to the capital even if he did not work.
3/1/5/4  It is a requirement that the proportions of losses borne
by  partners  be  commensurate  with  the  proportions
of their contributions to the Sharikah capital. It is not
permitted, therefore, to agree on holding one partner
or a group of partners liable for the entire loss or liable
for a percentage of loss that does not match their share
of  ownership  in  the  partnership.  It  is,  however,  valid
that one partner takes, without any prior condition, the
responsibility of bearing the loss at the time of the loss.
3/1/5/5  It  is  permissible  for  the  partners  to  agree  on  the
It  is  permissible  for  the  partners  to  agree  on  the
3/1/5/5
adoption of any method of allocation of profit, either
permanent or variable, for example, by agreeing that
the percentages of profit shares in the first period are
one set of percentages and in the second period are
another set of percentages, depending on the disparity
of the two periods or the magnitude of the realised
profit.  This  is  allowed  provided  that  using  such
a method does not lead to the likelihood of a partner
being precluded from participation in profit.
3/1/5/6  It is not permitted to start the allocation of profit be-
tween the partners unless the operating costs, expenses
and taxes are deducted in calculating the profit and the
capital of the Sharikah is maintained intact.
3/1/5/7  It is not permitted that the conditions or modes of profit
allocation in a Sharikah contract include any clause or
condition that may result in the probable violation of
the principle of sharing profit. For example, if a pre-
determined amount of profit or a specific percentage
of  capital  is  assigned  to  one  of  the  partners,  this
assignment  will  be  rendered  void.  If  the  assignment
333333
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
is amended before profit comes forth, profit shall be
divided  in  accordance  with  what  partners  agreed  on
as  to  amendment.  Otherwise,  profit  shall  be  divided
based on each partners respective share in capital.
3/1/5/8  Taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  item  3/1/5/3,
it is permissible to agree that if the profit realised is
above  a  certain  ceiling,  the  profit  in  excess  of  such
a ceiling belongs to a particular partner. The parties
may also agree that if the profit is not over the ceiling
or  is  below  the  ceiling,  the  distribution  will  be  in
accordance with their agreement.
3/1/5/9  The profit may be finally distributed on the basis of
the proceeds of selling all the existing assets, known
as  actual  valuation,  or  on  the  basis  of  constructive
valuation of assets which means valuation of the assets
of the Sharikah at fair value. The receivables must be
valued at the cash value that is expected to be realised,
i.e. after deduction of an allowance for doubtful debts.
In  valuing  receivables,  it  is  not  permitted  to  take
account of the time value of money (interest) or the
notion of discount on the basis of current value, i.e.
a discount of the amount of the debt as consideration
for  earlier  payment,  and  cash  amounts  shall  be
recognized as is.
3/1/5/10 It is not permitted that the final allocation of profit
take place based on expected profit, i.e. it is necessary
that  the  allocation  of  profit  take  place  on  the  basis
of actual profit earned through actual or constructive
valuation of the sold assets.
3/1/5/11 It is permissible to allocate some funds to any of the
partners on account, i.e. before actual or constructive
valuation, on condition that the final actual settlement
will take place at a later stage. In this case, the parties
334334
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
should  undertake  to  reimburse  to  the  Sharikah  any
amount  that  they  have  received  in  excess  of  their
share of profit after actual or constructive valuation.
3/1/5/12 If  the  subject  matter  of  Sharikah  is  assets  acquired
for leasing that bring in income or the subject matter
is  services  that  bring  in  revenue,  then  the  amount
distributed  to  the  partners  annually  is  on  account,
and it is subject to settlement and reimbursement at
the end of the Sharikah.
3/1/5/13 It is permissible, based on the articles of association
It is permissible, based on the articles of association
3/1/5/13
or a decision of the partners, not to distribute the
profits  of  the  company.  It  is  also  permissible  to  set
aside periodically a certain ratio of profit as a solvency
reserve  or  as  a  reserve  for  meeting  losses  of  capital
(investment  risk  reserve)  or  as  a  profit  equalisation
reserve.
3/1/5/14 It is permissible to agree on setting aside a proportion
of profit for non-partners as a charitable donation.
3/1/6 Maturity of Sharikah
3/1/6/1  Each  partner  is  entitled  to  terminate  the  Sharikah
(i.e. to withdraw from the partnership) after giving
his partner/s due notice to this effect, in which case
he shall be entitled to his share in the partnership, and
this withdrawal would not necessitate the termination
of  the  partnership  of  the  remaining  partners.  It  is
permissible for the partners to enter into a binding
promise  for  the  continuity  of  the  partnership  for
a period of time. In this case, it is permissible for the
parties to agree to terminate the partnership before
such a fixed period. In all these cases, the obligations
and actions that took place before termination will
remain unaffected and they will continue to exist.
335335
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
3/1/6/2  It is permissible for a partner to issue a binding promise
to buy, either within the period of operation or at the
time  of  liquidation,  all  the  assets  of  the  Sharikah  as
per their market value or as per agreement at the date
of  buying.  It  is  not  permissible,  however,  to  promise
to buy the assets of the Sharikah on the basis of face
value.
3/1/6/3  A  Sharikah  venture  comes  to  an  end  at  the  expiry
date  or  before  the  expiry  date  if  the  partners  agree
to  terminate  it  prematurely,  or,  in  the  case  of  part-
nership in a particular business, by actual liquidation
of the assets that constitute the subject matter of the
partnership. The termination of a Sharikah can take
place on the basis of constructive liquidation. In this
case, the Sharikah will be regarded as if it has been
ended and the parties have commenced a new part-
nership whereby the assets that were not sold through
actual liquidation, but have been valued on the basis
of constructive liquidation, will be considered as the
capital  of  the  new  partnership.  If  the  liquidation  is
based on the expiry date, then all the existing assets
shall be sold according to current market values and
the proceeds will be used as follows:
a)  Payment of liquidation expenses.
b)  Payment of financial liabilities from the net assets
of the partnership.
c)  Distribution  of  the  remaining  assets  among  the
partners  in  accordance  with  their  percentage  of
contribution to the capital. If the assets fall short
and the partners do not recover all of their contri-
buted capital, the distribution shall take place on
a pro rata basis to the shares of capital.

(liability partnership)
3/2  Partnership in creditworthiness or reputation (liability partnership)
3/2  Partnership in creditworthiness or reputation
3/2/1 A partnership in creditworthiness (partnership of liability) is
a bilateral agreement between two or more parties to conclude
a a partnership to buy assets on credit on the basis of their reputation
partnership to buy assets on credit on the basis of their reputation
for the purpose of making profit, whereby they undertake to
fulfil their obligations according to the percentages determined
by  the  parties.  In  addition,  the  parties  should  determine  for
each  partner  the  percentage  of  profit  sharing  and  of  liability
sharing, which latter may, by agreement, differ, downwards or
upwards, from the percentage of profit sharing.
3/2/2 The  partnership  in  creditworthiness  has  no  monetary  cap-
ital.  This  is  because  the  subject  matter  of  the  partnership  is
an obligation or a liability that is contingent on creditworthiness
(outstanding reputation). This is the obligation of the partners
to pay the amount of debts created through purchases on credit,
which form the liability of the partners. Therefore, the parties
should agree on the ratio of liability for which each partner is
responsible when paying such debts.
3/2/3 The  profit  shall  be  distributed  according  to  the  agreement.
However,  the  loss  will  be  borne  by  each  partner  according
to  the  ratio  that  each  partner  had  undertaken  to  bear  in
proportion to overall assets that are purchased on credit. It is
not permitted that the contract of partnership incorporates
a  provision  that  specifies  a  lump  sum  from  the  profit  for
a particular partner.
3/3  Service partnerships (professional or vocational partnerships and
partnerships in skilled trades)
3/3/1 A service partnership is an agreement between two or more
parties to provide services pertaining to a profession, vocation
or  skilled  trade  or  to  render  some  services  or  professional
advice or to manufacture goods, and to share profit according
to an agreed upon ratio.
337337
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
3/3/2  The service partnership has no monetary capital. This is because
the  subject  matter  of  the  partnership  is  rendering  services.
There  is  no  Shariah  implication  regarding  any  disproportion
in  the  services  the  partners  or  their  representatives  may  have
rendered.  The  partners  may  also  distribute  different  types  of
services among themselves and may assign some or all partners
a set of services or a particular service in a way that will achieve
the integration and purpose of the overall service to be rendered.
3/3/3 The  profit  shall  be  distributed  among  the  partners  according
to  the  agreed  ratio,  but  the  contract  should  not  specify  that
a lump sum be paid from the profit to a particular partner.
3/3/4 If  the  service  partnership  requires  capital  goods  (e.g.,  equip-
ment or tools), then it is permissible for each party to provide
the necessary goods that his services require, in which case each
partner owns the goods he has provided. The partners may con-
tribute funds to acquire the goods on the basis of a partnership
in  ownership.  It  is  also  permissible  for  a  party  to  a  Sharikah
contract to provide the capital goods required by the partner-
ship in consideration for fees that will be charged against the
Sharikah operation as expenses.

4/1  Stock company
4/1/1 Definition of a stock company
4/1/1/1  A stock company is a company of which the capital
is partitioned into equal units of tradable shares and
each shareholders (co-owners) liability is limited to
his share in the capital. It is a form of financing part-
nership. The rules  of Sharikat  al-Inan apply  to  this
nership.  The  rules  of  Sharikat  al-Inan  apply  to  this
company except on the issue of the limited liability of
the shareholders and the fact that this type of compa-
ny cannot be unilaterally terminated by one party or
a minority of its shareholders. [see items 4/1/2/1 and
4/1/2/9]
338338
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
4/1/1/2  The stock company has a juristic personality through
its incorporation by law in such a way that it cannot
avoid  its  obligations  to  people  dealing  with  it.  This
separates  the  liability  of  the  company  from  the
liability of its shareholders (the co-owners) and also
establishes for it a separate legal capacity as required
for  necessary  legal  arrangements,  irrespective  of  the
legal capacity of the shareholders. By definition, a stock
company is entitled to initiate legal claims through its
representative. It is subject to the jurisdiction of the
place of its incorporation.
4/1/2 Shariah Rulings relating to a stock company
4/1/2/1  The  contract  forming  a  stock  company  is  binding
during  the  duration  designated  by  the  articles  of
association for the continuity of the company on the
basis of the undertaking of the parties not to dissolve
the company unless the majority of the partners have
consented to do so. Therefore, no one is entitled to
dissolve  (to  terminate)  the  company  in  respect  to
his shares. However, a shareholder is entitled to sell
his shares or to relinquish title to them in favour of
another person.
4/1/2/2  It is permissible for the issuer of shares to add a certain
percentage  to  the  actual  value  of  the  shares  on  the
subscription date in order to recover issuing expenses,
provided that such percentage is appropriately estimated
to reflect the actual expenses incurred.
4/1/2/3  It is permissible to issue new shares in order to increase
the capital provided the new shares are issued at the
fair  value  of  the  old  shares.  This  should  be  done  in
accordance with the opinion of experts in valuation of
the companys assets. In other words, the new issues
can be issued at a premium or at a discount to their
nominal value, or issued at a market value.
339339
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
4/1/2/4  It is permissible that a shareholder underwrite an issue
of shares without any consideration. In such a case, there
is an agreement between a person and the company on
the date of incorporation of the company, or of a share
issue, to the effect that such a person is undertaking to
buy all or part of the shares issued. In other words, it
means an undertaking to subscribe all the remaining
shares  that  are  not  subscribed  at  its  nominal  value.
However, it is permissible for a shareholder to ask for
consideration  for  services  provided  other  than  the
underwriting, such as conducting feasibility studies or
marketing the shares.
4/1/2/5  It is permissible that a part of payment for subscrip-
tion of shares be made in an instalment and that the
other instalments be deferred. In this case, the paid
instalment  is  a  contribution  to  the  Sharikah  capi-
tal, and the deferral of some instalments constitutes
an undertaking to increase his share of capital in the
company subsequently. This is permissible provid-
ed the instalments cover all the shares and that the
companys  liability  is  confined  to  the  value  of  the
subscribed shares.
4/1/2/6  It is not permitted to purchase shares using interest-
based loans, provided by either a broker or any other
person, in consideration for mortgaging the shares as
a security for payment.
4/1/2/7  It is not permitted for someone to sell shares that he
does  not  own  and  the  promise  of  a  broker  to  lend
the  shares  to  him  at  the  date  of  delivery  does  not
constitute ownership or possession of the shares. This
is not allowed especially if the broker stipulates that
the seller must pay the price of the shares so that he
can  deposit  it  and  earn  interest  in  return  for  such
a loan.
340340
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
4/1/2/8  In the legitimate public interest, it is permissible for
the relevant authorities to organise trading in shares
in such a way that trading will not take place except
through specific licensed stockbrokers.
4/1/2/9  It is permissible to restrict the liability of a company to
its paid up capital if this is made public, in order to make
the  customers  of  the  company  aware  of  the  financial
position  of  the  company  without  any  uncertainty  or
lack of transparency.
4/1/2/10 It is permissible to sell shares in the company subject
to rules and regulations of the company that do not
conflict  with  Shariah,  such  as  pre-emptive  rights  of
the existing shareholders to purchase the shares.
4/1/2/11 It is permissible to mortgage the companys shares.
However, this is subject to the rules and regulations
of the company vis--vis the right of the shareholders
to  mortgage  their  ownership  rights  to  undivided
shares in the company.
4/1/2/12 It  is  permissible  to  issue  shares  to  the  order  of 
(nominative shares).
4/1/2/13 It is permissible to issue bearer shares. This is ex-
ecuted by handing over to the investor a certificate
that represents a right to shares in the company and
receiving their value in cash or acquiring a counter
deed recognising a debt against the shareholder. In
this  case,  the  common  ownership  of  shares  repre-
sented by the certificate is vested in the holder of the
certificate of shares at any time.
4/1/2/14 It is not permitted to issue preference shares, i.e. shares
that  have  special  financial  characteristics  that  give
them a priority at the date of liquidation of the company
or at the date of distribution of profit. However, it is
341341
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
permissible to grant certain shares, in addition to being
entitled to rights attached to common shares, certain
procedural  and  administrative  privileges,  such  as
a right of vote.

4/2  Joint-liability company
4/2/1 Definition of Joint-liability Company
4/2/1/1  A joint-liability company is a form of personal partner-
ship. It is a necessary requirement that this partnership
is publicly declared as a registered company assigned
a unique title (trademark).
4/2/1/2  A joint-liability company has a juristic personality and
independent financial liability unrelated to the liability
of the partners. Nevertheless, all the partners are per-
sonally responsible for the obligations and liabilities of
the company if the existing assets cannot meet the lia-
bilities of the company.
4/2/1/3  In  addition  to  maintaining  documents  of  the  joint-
liability  company,  the  partners  are  also  obliged  to
maintain commercial documents relating to external
trade activities.
4/2/2 Shariah Rulings relating to Joint-liability Companies
4/2/2/1  A creditor of a joint-liability company is entitled to
demand fulfilment of all or part of his rights from
any of the partners in any way the creditor deems fit.
Therefore, the creditor is not obliged to claim such
fulfilment from the company first.
342342
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
4/2/2/2  The contract of a joint-liability partnership is not bind-
ing; hence, a partner is entitled to withdraw from the
partnership on the following conditions:
a)  If the partners did not set a duration for the company.
If they agreed on a duration, then such duration must
be observed.
b) The partner should notify the other partners of the
b)  The partner should notify the other partners of the
intention to withdraw.
c)  If  the  unilateral  withdrawal  from  the  partnership
would not cause damage to other partners.
4/2/2/3  It is not permissible for the partner to bring in a sub-
stitute for himself without the agreement of the other
partners.
4/3  Partnership in commendum
4/3/1 Definition of partnership in commendum
4/3/1/1  Partnership in commendum is a form of financing
partnership. This is because the personality of the op-
erating partner is important for the sleeping partner
and because there is a difference in terms of determi-
nation of the ownership of the partners, whereby the
ownership  is  calculated  based  on  disproportionate

this partnership are jointly liable for the obligations
of  the  company  from  their  personal  wealth  on  the
basis of joint-liability. The liability of each sleeping
partner is limited to the number of lots he owns and
his liability does not extend to his personal assets. It

does not even allow that their names be mentioned
on the date of the registration of the company. Only
the funds collected from the sleeping partners are

either to one of the joint liability partners or to a third
party. The sleeping partners are not entitled to manage
the company.

assets on the basis of joint liability. They are in the
position  of  a  person  who  works  as  a  Mudarib  and
simultaneously  participates  in  a  partnership.  The
sleeping partners liability is limited to the number
of  the  shares  each  partner  owns  and  does  not
extend to his own assets. In this case, the liability of
sleeping partners is equivalent to that of the capital
providers in a Mudarabah contract. It is permissible
to  limit  the  liability  of  some  investors  without  any
consideration  for  limiting  their  liability,  in  which
case the company consists of joint liability partners
and partners with limited liability. [see item 4/1/2/9]
4/4/2/2  It is not permissible for the sleeping partners to inter-
fere  in  the  operations  of  the  company.  The  law  does
not even allow that their names are mentioned on the

lotment partnership [see item 3/1]. This type of
345345
Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
ship belongs to the personal (private) form of company.
The reason for this is that the partners take into account
before  concluding  a  partnership  each  ones  financial
strength and ability to meet financial obligations from
his personal assets.
4/5/1/2  Sharikat  al-Muhassah  has  no  juristic  personality
because people other than the partners do not know
about it. This partnership does not have any separate
financial liability as an entity.
4/5/2 Shariah rulings relating to Muhassah Company
4/5/2/1 The rulings for and basis of a Muhassah company do
not  differ  from  those  for  an  Inan  partnership.  [see
item 3/1]
4/5/2/2  The liability of partners is personal and, as such, they
are liable for the liabilities of the company from their
personal assets. The rules for and classification of an
allotment partnership do not differ from Inan part-
nership.
4/5/2/3  The contract of a Muhassah partnership is not binding.
However,  if  the  parties  agree  to  make  it  binding  for
a particular period of time, then they shall be bound
by such an agreement. [see 4/3/2/2]
4/5/2/4  A  partner  in  Sharikat  al-Muhassah  is  entitled  to
terminate  his  partnership  on  condition  that  (I)  he
notifies other partners of his intention to withdraw
and (II) the unilateral withdrawal from partnership
would not cause damage to other partners or clients
of the company. The partnership can be liquidated
by  way  of  actual  or  constructive  liquidation  of  the
companys assets.
5. Diminishing Musharakah
5/1  Diminishing Musharakah is a form of partnership in which one of
the  partners  promises  to  buy  the  equity  share  of  the  other  partner

agreement  must  be  independent  of  the  partnership  contract.  It  is
not  permitted  that  one  contract  be  entered  into  as  a  condition  for
concluding the other.
5/2  The general rules for partnerships must be applied to a diminishing
partnership, especially the rules for Sharikat al-Inan. Therefore, it is
not permitted that the contract of diminishing partnership include
any clause that gives any of the parties a right to withdraw his share
in the capital.
5/3  It is not permitted to stipulate that one partner should bear all the cost
of insurance or maintenance on the ground that he will eventually
own the subject matter of the partnership.
5/4  Each partner should contribute part of the capital. The contribution
may be in the form of cash or tangible assets that can be translated
into a monetary value, for example, a land for building or equipment
required for the operation of partnership. The loss, if any, shall be
borne periodically by the parties in accordance with the participation
ratio of each partner as the equity stake of one partner decreases and
the stake of the other partner increases.
5/5  The ratio of profit or income of the partnership that each partner
(the  Institution  and  customer)  is  entitled  to  should  be  clearly
determined. However, it is permissible for the partners to agree on
a ratio of profit sharing that is disproportionate to the ratio of equity
ownership. It is also permissible for the partners either to maintain
the ratio of profit already determined even if the ratio of equity shares
has changed, or to agree on amending the ratio of profit sharing due
to the change in the ratio of equity shares. In doing so, they must
ensure that the principle of allocation of losses in accordance with
the ratio of equity share of ownership is maintained.

Shariah Standard No. (12): Sharikah (Musharakah), and Modern Corporations
5/6  It is not permitted to stipulate that one partner has a right to receive
a lump sum out of the profits. [see item 3/1/5/8]
5/7  It is permissible for one of the partners to give a binding promise that
entitles the other partner to acquire, on the basis of a sale contract,
his equity share gradually, according to the market value or a price
agreed  at  the  time  of  acquisition.  However,  it  is  not  permitted  to
stipulate that the equity share be acquired at their original or face
value, as this would constitute a guarantee of the value of the equity
shares of one partner (the Institution) by the other partner, which is
prohibited by Shariah.
5/8  The partners may arrange for the acquisition of the equity share of
the Institution in a manner that serves the interests of both parties.
This  includes,  for  example,  a  promise  by  the  Institutions  client  to
set aside a portion of the profit or the return he may earn from the
partnership for the acquisition of a percentage of the equity of the
Institution.  The  subject  matter  of  the  partnership  may  be  divided
into  shares,  in  which  case  the  Institutions  partner  can  purchase
a  particular  number  of  these  shares  at  certain  intervals  until  the
partner  becomes  the  owner  of  the  entire  shares  and  consequently
becomes the sole owner of the subject matter of the partnership.
5/9  It is permissible for either of the partners to rent or to lease the share
of the other partner for a specified amount and for whatever duration,
in which case each partner will remain responsible for the periodical
maintenance of his share on a timely basis.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Permissibility of Partnership
The Fuqaha have classified partnerships into four categories, namely
Sharikat  al-Inan  (contractual  partnership),  Sharikat  al-Abdan  (skilled
trade  partnership),  Sharikat  al-Mufawadah  (agency-like  partnership)
Sharikat al-Wujuh (creditworthiness or reputation partnership). The
and Sharikat al-Wujuh (creditworthiness or reputation partnership). The
and
most important of
all is Sharikat al- Inan (contractual partnership). The
most important of all is Sharikat al- Inan (contractual partnership). The
permissibility of this form of partnership is established by the Qur`an,
the Sunnah and practical consensus of the Fuqaha.
The permissibility of Sharikah is supported by the Saying of Allah, the
(And,  verily,  many  partners  oppress  one  another,  except
Almighty:  (And,  verily,  many  partners  oppress  one  another,  except
Almighty:
those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and they are few).(2)(2)
those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and they are few)
Among the Sunnah provisions that support the permissibility of part-
nership is the case of Al-Sa`ib Ibn Abu Al-Sa`ib Al-Makhzumi who was
a partner of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in business at the beginning
of Islam. On the day when the Prophet (peace be upon him) conquered
Mecca, he met Al-Sa`ib, then he (peace be upon him) said:
Welcome my
Mecca, he met Al-Sa`ib, then he (peace be upon him) said: Welcome my
brother and my partner. He jokes not (i.e. he is serious in business) and do
not argue (unnecessarily).(3)(3)
not argue (unnecessarily).
Moreover,  partnership  is  one  of  the  main  transactions  in  all  societies
since the advent of Islam. This constitutes, therefore, a practical consensus
for the permissibility and validity of partnerships.
The partnerships for which the jurists have clarified their rules are the
origins of the modern corporations, such as joint-stock companies whose

financial standing and obligations are related to the volume of the shares
of  the  company  and  on  its  juristic  personality,  not  on  the  personality  of
the  shareholders.  Therefore,  the  general  rules  for  various  partnerships
in  Shariah  will  govern  modern  forms  of  corporations.  However,  the
procedural  systems  relating  to  representation  of  partnership  companies
and  bureaucratic,  administrative  and  accounting  procedures  are  required
by Maslahah (consideration of the public good or common need), which is
an acceptable source for validating human actions provided it is employed
in line with the principles of Shariah.
The general basis of Sharikah is agency (Wakalah) because each partner
is acting as a principal partner, on one hand, and acting in the interest of
the partnership, on the other hand, as an agent for the remaining partners.
Unlike other partnerships,

  It is permitted to conclude a partnership contract with non-Muslims
It is permitted to conclude a partnership contract with non-Muslims
or conventional banks for carrying out permissible operations in asso-
ciation with necessary guarantees that they will observe Shariah pre-
cepts and principles. The Shariah basis for this is the Hadith stating:

Jews and Christians unless the selling and buying is in the hands of the
MuslimMuslim..(4)(4) The cause of the prohibition is the fear of being involved in
 The cause of the prohibition is the fear of being involved in

Capital of Sharikah
  The basis for the requirement that a payment of contribution to
The basis for the permissibility that Sharikah capital may be contributed
  The basis for the permissibility that Sharikah capital may be contributed
in the form of tangible assets other than cash, after valuation, is that the
purpose  of  Sharikah  is  to  give  partners  a  right  to  use  the  contributed
money freely and to share the profit. This objective is realisable even if the
capital is contributed in the form of tangible assets just as it is in the case
of a contribution in cash. Therefore, it is just as valid to present tangible
assets for Sharikah investment as to present cash. At the liquidation, each
one of the partners will be entitled to the equivalent value of the assets
presented  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Sharikah.(8)(8)  This  is  the  view  of  the
presented  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Sharikah.

Sharikah
The basis for the requirement that a payment of contribution to Sharikah
capital  in  a  currency  different  from  the  designated  currency  of
partnership must be valued according to the current exchange rate
at  the  time  of  payment  is  that  this  action  is  a  currency  exchange
between  two  currencies  which  is  permitted  provided  it  is  carried
out at the current exchange rate. This is evidenced by the Hadith in
which Ibn Umar asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) concerning
selling  camels  at  (a  place  in  Medina  called  Al-Baqi)  in  a  currency
and collecting payment in a different currency. The Prophet (peace
be upon him) endorsed the transaction provided it had taken place
(10)
according to the current exchange rate.(10)

  The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  investments  of  parties  in  the
The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  investments  of  parties  in  the
capital should be properly determined is that failure to do so will lead
to  ambiguity  in  respect  to  the  capital.  It  is  not  permissible  that  the
capital of Sharikah be ambiguous since certainty as to the amount of
the capital is a benchmark for sharing profit. The equitable distribution
of profit is not possible if the amount of capital contributed by each

party is ambiguous.(11)
party is ambiguous.
  The  basis  for  rejecting  payment  of  partnership  capital  in  receivables
The  basis  for  rejecting  payment  of  partnership  capital  in  receivables
alone is that debts owed to a partner by another partner cannot actually
be used in partnership operations, as they are not assets in possession.

The  basis  for  allowing  current  accounts  as  capital  in  partnership  is
that, in spite of their being considered as loan, they are presumed to
be possessed by the accountholders because the funds are available on
demand. This is because the Institutions are obliged by their regulations
and directives of the supervisory bodies to pay the owner on demand
or accept cheques against these accounts irrespective of the financial
situation of the Institution.
Managing a Partnership
  The basis for the right of each partner to participate in the management
The basis for the right of each partner to participate in the management
of the partnership is that partnership is based on elements of agency
and trust. The element of agency requires that each party be entitled to
be involved in the operations in a manner that is in the interest of the
partnership. The element of trust requires that each party act for the

benefit of the partnership.(13)

  The  basis  for  not  allowing  a  fixed  remuneration  for  a  partner  who
assists  in  the  management  is  that  this  may  lead  to  guaranteeing  the

in proportion to his contribution in the capital.
  The basis for the permissibility of appointing, by a separate independent
The basis for the permissibility of appointing, by a separate independent
contract, one partner to manage the partnership and the permissibility
of paying him wages is that the partner becomes an employee of the

  The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  an  agreement  to  determine  the
profit share on the basis of a lump sum or a percentage of the capital is
because this is inconsistent with the sharing of profit and because profit
is not realised unless the capital is maintained intact.

  The basis for the impermissibility of deferring the statement of the profit
The basis for the impermissibility of deferring the statement of the profit
ratio of each party until profit is realised is because such a procedure
involves  uncertainty  which  may  potentially  lead  to  dispute.  However,
the parties are entitled to amend the profit ratio or to relinquish a right
to profit on the date of distribution. This is because the profit belongs
to  them;  hence,  it  is  permissible  for  them  to  make  amendments  or
relinquishments.
  The basis for the requirement that the profit share may be either pro-
The basis for the requirement that the profit share may be either pro-
portionate or disproportionate to the contribution of each party in the
capital is that an individual deserves a share in profit on the basis of
the funds contributed, the work done or the risk borne. If an indivi-
dual is involved in any of these three, then it is allowed for the parties
to agree on a profit ratio accordingly. This is the opinion of the Hanafi

and Hanbali schools.(17)

The basis for the impermissibility of one party bearing losses or that

each party bear a portion of losses that may not be proportionate to
the share of each party in the capital is the saying of Ali Ibn Abu Talib
(may Allah be pleased with him): Profit distribution is according to
agreement of the partners and loss must be borne in proportion to the

contribution in the capital.
 Therefore, it is a void condition that one
party should bear the loss of other parties and such a condition facili-
tates misappropriation of the property of others.
  The basis for the permissibility of the partners agreeing on any method
The basis for the permissibility of the partners agreeing on any method
for  allocation  of  profit,  whether  fixed  or  variable  during  a  particular
period, is that this agreement is circumscribed with a condition that the
method adopted should not contravene any Shariah principle, which
means the method should not preclude a party from sharing in profit.
The basis for not allowing final distribution of profit before deduction
  The basis for not allowing final distribution of profit before deduction
of expenses and expenditure is that there is no profit unless the capital
is maintained intact.

  The basis for not allowing a partner to earn a share of profit and a fee
The basis for not allowing a partner to earn a share of profit and a fee

Contract Partnership (Sharikat al-Aqd)
Contract partnership is an agreement between two or more parties to
combine their assets or to merge their services or obligations and liabilities
with the aim of making profit.
Partnership of Ownership (Sharikat al-Milk)
Partnership  of  ownership  (Sharikat  al-Milk)  is  the  combination  of  the
assets of two or more persons in a manner that creates a state of sharing the
realised profit or income or benefiting from an increase in the value of the
partnership assets. This combination of assets for making profit necessitates
bearing losses, if any. The ownership partnership is created by events beyond
the partners control such as the inheritance rights of heirs in the legacy of
a deceased person. This partnership is also created by the wish of the partners
such as when two or more parties acquire common shares in a particular asset.
Mufawadah Partnership
Mufawadah  partnership  is  any  partnership  in  which  the  parties  are
equal in all respects, such as funds contributed by them, their right to act
and their liability, from the commencement of the partnership to the date
of its termination.
Sharecropping Partnership (Muzaraah)
Sharecropping is partnership in crops in which one party presents land
to another for cultivation and maintenance in consideration for a common
defined share in the crop.
Irrigating Partnership (Musaqat)
Irrigating partnership is a partnership that depends on one party presenting
designated plants/trees that produce edible fruits to another in order to work

Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers Mudarabah contracts between the Institution and the
other entities or individuals. It also covers joint investment accounts and
special purpose investment accounts if these accounts are administered
on the basis of Mudarabah.
  The standard does not cover Sukuk of Mudarabah (Mudarabah Certifi-
cates) or other types of partnership contracts, as these are covered by sep-
arate standards.
2. Definition of Mudarabah
  Mudarabah is a partnership in profit whereby one party provides capital
(Rab al-Mal) and the other party provides labour (Mudarib).
3. Agreement of Mudarabah Financing
3/1  It is permissible, on the basis of a general framework or a memo-
randum of understanding, to conclude Mudarabah financing con-
tracts for a particular sum of money and within a particular defined
duration provided that the memorandum of understanding will be
later  implemented  in  line  with  specific  or  successive  Mudarabah
transactions.
3/2  The memorandum of understanding should define the general con-
tractual  framework,  indicating  the  intention  of  the  parties  to  use
either  unrestricted  or  restricted  Mudarabah  financing  instrument,
either through revolving transactions or separate transactions. Also,
the memorandum of understanding should indicate the profit ratio,
and  type  of  guarantees  that  shall  be  presented  by  the  Mudarib  to
cover situations of negligence, misconduct or breach of contract and
other relevant issues in this regard.
370370
Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
3/3  If the Mudarabah contract is actually concluded on the basis of the
memorandum of understanding, the contents of the memorandum
become an integral part of any future contract, unless the parties had
originally agreed to exempt themselves from some of the obligations
mentioned therein.
4. Mudarabah Contract
4/1  The  Mudarabah  contract  may  be  concluded  using  terms  such  as
Mudarabah, Qirad or Muamalah.
4/2  Both parties should possess the legal capacity to appoint agents and
accept agency. Therefore, a Mudarabah contract may not be concluded
in the absence of two contracting parties with absolute legal capacity
or  of  their  agents  who  enjoy  legal  capacity  similar  to  that  of  the
contracting parties.
4/3  The general principle is that a Mudarabah contract is not binding, i.e.
each of the contracting parties may terminate it unilaterally except in
two cases:
4/3/1 When the Mudarib has already commenced the business, in
which  case  the  Mudarabah  contract  becomes  binding  up  to
the date of actual or constructive liquidation.
4/3/2 When the contracting parties agree to determine a duration for
which the contract will remain in operation. In this case, the
contract  cannot  be  terminated  prior  to  the  end  of  the  desig-
nated duration, except by mutual agreement of the contracting
parties.
4/4  A Mudarabah contract is one of the trust-based contracts. Therefore,
the Mudarib is investing Mudarabah capital on a trust basis in which
case  the  Mudarib  is  not  liable  for  losses  except  in  case  of  breach
of the requirements of trust, such as misconduct in respect to the
Mudarabah fund, negligence and breach of the terms of Mudarabah
contract.  In  committing  any  of  these,  the  Mudarib  becomes  liable
for the amount of the Mudarabah capital.
371371
Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
5. Types of Mudarabah
  Mudarabah contracts are divided into unrestricted and restricted Muda-
rabah.
5/1  An unrestricted Mudarabah contract is a contract in which the capital
provider permits the Mudarib to administer a Mudarabah fund without
any restrictions. In this case, the Mudarib has a wide range of trade or
business freedom on the basis of trust and the business expertise he has
acquired. An example of unrestricted Mudarabah is when the capital
provider  says,  Do  business  according  to  your  expertise.  However,
such  unrestricted  business  freedom  in  an  unrestricted  Mudarabah
must be exercised only in accordance with the interests of the parties
and the objectives of the Mudarabah contract, which is making profit.
Therefore, the actions of the Mudarib must be in accordance with the
business customs relating to the Mudarabah operations: the subject
matter of the contract.
5/2  A restricted Mudarabah contract is a contract in which the capital
provider restricts the actions of the Mudarib to a particular location
or to a particular type of investment as the capital provider considers
appropriate, but not in a manner that would unduly constrain the
Mudarib in his operations.
6. Guarantees in a Mudarabah Contract
  The capital provider is permitted to obtain guarantees from the Mudarib
that are adequate and enforceable. This is circumscribed by a condition
that the capital provider will not enforce these guarantees except in cases
of misconduct, negligence or breach of contract on the part of Mudarib.
7. Requirements Relating to the Capital
7/1  In  principle,  the  capital  of  Mudarabah  must  be  provided  in  the
form of cash. However, it may be presented in the form of tangible
assets, in which case the value of the assets is the contribution to the
Mudarabah capital. The valuation of the assets may be conducted
by experts or as agreed upon by the contracting parties.
372372
Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
7/2  The capital of Mudarabah should be clearly known to the contracting
parties and defined in terms of quality and quantity in a manner that
eliminates any possibility of uncertainty or ambiguity.
7/3  It is not permissible to use a debt owed by the Mudarib or another
party to the capital provider as capital in a Mudarabah contract.
7/4  For  a  Mudarabah  contract  to  be  valid  and  for  the  Mudarib  to  be
considered  as  having  control  over  the  capital,  the  capital  must  be,
wholly or partially, put at the disposal of the Mudarib, or the Mudarib
must have free access to the capital.
8. Rulings And Requirements Relating to Profit
8/1  It is a requirement that the mechanism for distributing profit must
be clearly known in a manner that eliminates uncertainty and any
possibility of dispute. The distribution of profit must be on the basis
of an agreed percentage of the profit and not on the basis of a lump
sum or a percentage of the capital.
8/2  In principle, it is not permissible to earn a share of profit in addi-
tion to a fee in a Mudarabah contract. However, it is permissible
for the two parties to construct a separate agreement independent
of  the  Mudarabah  contract  assigning  one  party  to  perform,  for
a fee, a business activity that is not by custom part of Mudarabah
operations.  The  independence  of  this  separate  agreement  means
that if the contract of providing this activity is terminated, this will
not affect the contract of Mudarabah.
8/3  The parties shall agree on the ratio of profit distribution when the
contract is concluded. It is also permissible for the parties to change
the ratio of distribution of profit at any time and to define the duration
for which the agreement will remain valid.
8/4  If the parties did not stipulate the ratio of profit distribution, then they
shall  refer  to  customary  practice,  if  any,  to  determine  the  shares
of profit. If the customary practice is that the profit is distributed
equally, then this will be applied as such. If there is no customary
practice  in  this  regard,  the  Mudarabah  contract  is  regarded  void
373373
Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
ab  initio,  and  the  party  who  acts  as  the  Mudarib  should  receive
a common market price for the kind and amount of services that he
provided as Mudarib.
8/5  If one of the parties stipulates that he should receive a lump sum of
money,  the  Mudarabah  contract  shall  be  void.  This  rule  does  not
apply to a situation where the parties agree that if the profit is over
a particular ceiling then one of the parties will take the additional
profit and if the profit is below or equal to the amount of the ceiling
the distribution of profit will be in accordance with their agreement.
 8/6 It is not permissible for the capital provider to give the Mudarib two
amounts  of  capitals  on  condition  that  the  profit  earned  on  one  of
the two amounts would be taken by the Mudarib while the capital
provider would take the profit earned on the other amount. It is not
also  permissible  for  the  capital  provider  to  state  that  the  profit  of
one financial period would be taken by the Mudarib and the capital
provider  would  take  the  profit  of  the  following  financial  period.
Similarly, it is not permissible to assign the profit from a particular
transaction to the Mudarib and the profit from another transaction
to the capital provider.
8/7  No  profit  can  be  recognised  or  claimed  unless  the  capital  of  the
Mudarabah is maintained intact. Whenever a Mudarabah operation
incurs losses, such losses stand to be compensated by the profits of
future  operations  of  the  Mudarabah.  The  losses  brought  forward
should  be  set  against  the  future  profits.  All  in  all,  the  distribution
of  profit  depends  on  the  final  result  of  the  operations  at  the  time
of liquidation of the Mudarabah contract. If losses are greater than
profits  at  the  time  of  liquidation,  the  balance  (net  loss)  must  be
deducted from the capital. In this case, as he is a trustee the Mudarib
is not liable for the amount of this loss, unless there is negligence or
misconduct on his part. If the total Mudarabah expenses are equal
to the total Mudarabah revenues, the capital provider will receive his
capital back without either profit or loss, and there will be no profit
in  which  the  Mudarib  is  entitled  to  a  share.  If  profit  is  realised,  it
must be distributed between the parties as per the agreement.
374374
Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
8/8  The Mudarib is entitled to a share of profit as soon as it is clear that
the operations of the Mudarabah have led to the realisation of a profit.
However, this entitlement is not absolute, as it is subject
to the retention
However, this entitlement is not absolute, as it is subject to the retention
of interim profits for the protection of the capital. It will be an absolute
right only after distribution, i.e. when actual or constructive valuations
take place. It is permissible to distribute the realised profit among the
parties on account, in which case the distribution will be revised when
actual or constructive valuation takes place. The final distribution of
profit  should  be  made  based  on  the  selling  price  of  the  Mudarabah
assets, which is known as actual valuation. It is also permissible that
the profit be distributed on the basis of constructive valuation, which
is valuation of the assets on the basis of fair value. Receivables shall be
measured at the cash equivalent, or net realisable value, i.e. after the
deduction of a provision for doubtful debts. In measuring receivables,
neither  time  value  (interest  rate)  nor  discount  on  current  value  for
extension of period of payment shall be taken into consideration.
8/9  If the Mudarib has commingled his own funds with the Mudarabah
funds, the Mudarib becomes a partner in respect of his funds and
a Mudarib in respect of the funds of the capital provider. The profit
earned on the two commingled funds will be divided proportionately
to the amounts of the two funds, in which case the Mudarib takes
the profit attributable to his own funds, while the remaining profit
is to be distributed between the Mudarib and the capital provider
according to the provisions of the Mudarabah contract.
9. Duties and Powers of the Mudarib
  The Mudarib should employ his best efforts to accomplish the objectives
of  the  Mudarabah  contract.  The  Mudarib  should  assure  the  capital
provider that his money is in good hands that will act to find the best
ways of investing it in a permissible manner.
9/1  If a Mudarabah contract is concluded on an unrestricted basis, the
Mudarib is permitted, in general, to do what entrepreneurs do in his
field of activity, including the following:
375375
Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
9/1/1 Attending to all permissible investment or trading fields that
are  feasible,  given  the  amount  of  the  capital  at  his  disposal,
and in which he believes that his expertise, and technical and
professional qualifications are likely to give him the ability to
compete effectively.
9/1/2 Carrying out the work himself or appointing another person to
carry out some work if necessary, such as buying a commodity
or marketing it for him.
9/1/3 Choosing as far as possible appropriate places and markets that
are seemingly free of risks.
9/1/4 Safeguarding the Mudarabah funds or depositing them in the
custody of a trustworthy person whenever appropriate.
9/1/5 Selling and buying on a deferred payment basis.
9/1/6 The Mudarib may do, either by permission or appointment of
the capital provider, the following:
a) The  Mudarib  may,  at  any  time,  combine  a  Mudarabah
contract
and a partnership (Sharikah) contract, irrespective
contract and a partnership (Sharikah) contract, irrespective
of whether this takes place at the outset of the contract or
after the commencement of Mudarabah operations, and of
whether the partnership contribution is from the Mudarib
himself or from a third party. The mixture of unrestricted
investment deposits with the Institutions funds is an exa-
mple of this kind of combination.
b) The  Mudarib  may  accept  funds  from  a  third  party  on
a Mudarabah basis if this new contract will not affect his
investment  and  management  responsibility  in  respect  of
the first Mudarabah contract.
9/2  It is permissible for the capital provider, on the basis of his interests,
to place restrictions on the actions of the Mudarib. Thus, Mudarabah
operations may be restricted to a specified time and place, so that the
Mudarib may only invest the Mudarabah funds during a particular
time period or in a specified country or in a market of a particular
376376
Shariah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah
country. In addition, the Mudarabah operations may be restricted
to investment in certain sectors such as services or trade sectors or
a single commodity or a group of commodities. However, restricting
the Mudarabah operations to certain commodities is circumscribed
with a condition that such commodities must be commonly available
so  that,  other  things  being  equal,  the  restriction  will  not  prevent
the objectives of the Mudarabah contract from being achieved. For
example,  the  commodities  to  which  the  Mudarabah  is  restricted
must not be scarce, seasonal (and out of season) or in very limited
supply with the consequence that the objectives of the Mudarabah
contract cannot be achieved.
9/3  The capital provider is not permitted to stipulate that he has a right
to  work  with  the  entrepreneur  (Mudarib)  and  to  be  involved  in
selling and buying activities, or supplying and ordering. However,
the  Mudarib  should  refer  to  him  in  performing  any  action  and
should  not  act  without  consulting  him.  Also,  the  capital  provider
is not entitled to lay down conditions that will restrict movements
or  actions  of  the  Mudarib,  such  as  a  stipulation  that  the  Mudarib
must enter into a partnership with others or a stipulation that the
Mudarib must mix his personal funds with the Mudarabah funds.
9/4  The Mudarib must carry out all the work that any similar asset or
fund  manager  would  be  liable,  by  custom,  to  do.  In  this  case,  the
Mudarib is not entitled to a fee for this work as this is part of his
responsibilities. If the Mudarib appoints another party on an Ijarah
(hiring  contract)  basis  to  carry  out  such  work,  the  wages  for  the
worker must be paid from the personal funds of the Mudarib and
not from the Mudarabah funds. The Mudarib may hire against the
account of Mudarabah funds another party, at the prevailing rate, to
execute work that is not by custom the responsibility of the Mudarib.
9/5  The Mudarib is not entitled to sell items for the Mudarabah operation
at  less  than  the  common  or  market  price,  or  to  buy  items  for  the
Mudarabah operation at a price higher than common prices, unless
if such action in either case is intended to achieve an objective that is
obviously in the interest of the Mudarabah.

It  is  not  permissible  for  the  Mudarib  to  make  a  loan  or  a  gift  or
a charitable donation out of the Mudarabah funds. Likewise, the
Mudarib is not entitled to waive a right associated with the Mu-
darabah operation unless the capital provider has consented to his
doing so.

9/7  If  the  Mudarib  has  a  right  to  receive  living  expenses  from  the
Mudarabah funds that has been approved by the capital provider,
then he is entitled to the amount so approved for him. If there is no
agreement on this, then the Mudarib should take living expenses in
accordance with custom and reason. The Mudarib is also entitled to
travelling expenses in accordance with custom and reason.
10. Liquidation of a Mudarabah Contract
10/1 A Mudarabah contract can be liquidated in the following manner:
10/1/1 Being a non-binding contract, it can be liquidated by uni-
lateral termination of the contract by one of the parties.
[see item 4/3]
10/1/2 With the agreement of both parties.
10/1/3 On the date of maturity if the two parties had earlier agreed
to set a time limit for it. [see item 3/4]
10/1/4  When the funds of Mudarabah contract have been exhausted
or have suffered losses.
10/1/5 The death of the Mudarib or the liquidation of the institution
that acts as Mudarib.
10/2 On the maturity of a Mudarabah operation, the assets should be
liquidated in the manner explained in item 8/8.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
In  its  meeting  No.  (5)  held  in  Makkah  Al-Mukarramah  during  the
period of 8-12 Ramadan 1421 A.H., corresponding to 4-8 December 2001
A.D.,  the  Shariah  Board  decided  to  give  priority  to  the  preparation  of
a Shariah Standard on Mudarabah.
On Saturday 15 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H., corresponding to 10 March 2001
A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee recommended to the Shariah
Board  the  commissioning  of  a  Shariah  consultant  to  prepare  a  juristic
study and an exposure draft on the Shariah Standard for Mudarabah.
In  its  meeting  held  on  18  Muharram  1422  A.H.,  corresponding  to
12  April  2001  A.D.,  the  Fatwa  and  Arbitration  Committee  discussed
the  exposure  draft  of  the  Shariah  Rules  for  Mudarabah  and  asked  the
consultant  to  make  amendments  in  light  of  the  comments  made  by  the
members. The Committee also held a meeting on 20 Jumada II, 1422 A.H.,
corresponding to 8 December 2001 A.D., and made some amendments in
light of the comments made by the members.
The revised exposure draft of the Standard was presented to the Shariah
Board  in  its  7th  meeting  held  in  Makkah  Al-Mukarramah  during  the
period  of  9-13  Ramadan  1422  A.H.,  corresponding  to  24-28  November
2001 A.D. The Shariah Board made further amendments to the exposure
draft of the Standard and decided that it should be distributed to specialists
and interested parties in order to obtain their comments with the objective
of discussing them in a public hearing.
A public hearing was held in Bahrain during the period of 29-20 Dhul-
Hajjah  1422  A.H.,  corresponding  to  2-3  February  2002  A.D.  The  public
380380

hearing was attended by more than thirty participants representing central
Institutions,  Institutions,  accounting  firms,  Shariah  scholars,  academics
and  others  who  are  interested  in  this  field.  Some  of  the  members  of  the
Shariah Board responded to the written comments that were sent prior to
the public hearing as well as to the oral comments that were expressed in
the public hearing.
The Shariah Standards Committee in its meeting held during the period
of 21-22 Dhul-Hajjah 1422 A.H., corresponding to 6-7 March 2002 A.D.,
in the Kingdom of Bahrain discussed the comments made on the exposure
draft. The Committee made the amendments which it considered necessary
in light of both the discussions that had taken place in the public hearing
and the written comments that had been received.
The Shariah Board in its 8th meeting held on 28 Safar - 4 Rabi I, 1423 A.H.,
corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah
discussed  the  amendments  made  by  the  Shariah  Standards  Committee,
and made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary. Some
paragraphs  of  the  standard  were  adopted  by  the  unanimous  vote  of  the
members of the Shariah Board, while the other paragraphs were adopted
by  the  majority  vote  of  the  members,  as  recorded  in  the  minutes  of  the
Shariah Board.
The Shariah Standards Review Committee reviewed the Standard in its
meeting held on Rabi II, 1433 A.H., corresponding to March 2012 A.D.,
in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments
(additions,  deletions,  and  rephrasing)  as  deemed  necessary,  and  then
submitted the proposed amendments to the Shariah Board for approval as
it deemed necessary.
In its 41st meeting held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia during the period of 27-29 Shaban 1436 A.H., corresponding
to  14-16  June  2015  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Board  discussed  the  proposed
amendments  submitted  by  the  Shariah  Standards  Review  Committee.
After deliberation, the Shariah Board approved necessary amendments,
and the Standard was adopted in its current amended version.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Permissibility of Mudarabah and Its Rationale
Mudarabah, known also as Qirad, is a contract that arranges cooperation
   Mudarabah, known also as Qirad, is a contract that arranges cooperation
in business investment between capital on one hand and entrepreneurship
on the other, whereby the contracting parties jointly and commonly own
the realised profit as per the agreement. The party providing the capital
is  known  Rab  al-Mal  and  the  investor  is  known  as  Mudarib  or  Amil
(literally. worker) or Muqarid.(2)(2)
(literally. worker) or Muqarid.

and seeking permissible income in order to provide for themselves

b)  From  the  Sunnah  is  the  Hadith  that  says,  Al-Abbas  Ibn  Abdul-
Muttalib  used  to  pay  money  for  Mudarabah  and  to  stipulate  to  the
Mudarib that he should not travel by sea, pass by valleys or trade in
livestock,  and  that  the  Mudarib  would  be  liable  for  any  losses  if  he
did so. These conditions were brought before the Prophet (peace be
upon  him)  and  he  approved  them.(5)(5)  Among  the  Hadiths  regarding

  The  rationale  for  making  this  contract  permissible  includes  the
following:
a) Money  cannot  increase  unless  it  is  associated  with  work.  It  is  also
not permissible to provide money in return for a periodic pre-agreed
payment  (rent)  to  a  person  who  is  willing  to  invest  it  as  this  will
constitute a debt with Riba.
b) The Mudarabah contract is made permissible to facilitate investment
cooperation between capital providers who are not prepared to invest
and  manage  their  money  themselves,  and  competent  business  or
investment experts who lack adequate capital. In other words, there
are some individuals who are rich but lack business or investment
know-how  and  others  who  have  business  or  investment  expertise
but  lack  money.  This  situation  thus  calls  for  the  permissibility  of
the Mudarabah contract so as to combine the interests of the two
parties.(8)(8)
parties.
Moreover, a Mudarabah contract is an instrument that was commonly
used in trade and which usage expanded in modern times to include busi-
ness, services, and agricultural or horticultural and industrial activities.
a) The business philosophy of conventional banks depends on the concept
of  renting  out  money  and  making  profit  in  doing  so,  while  Shariah
prohibits  this  philosophy  because  of  its  being  Riba.  The  Mudarabah
financing instrument has been an essential instrument to develop Islamic
financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions). This instrument is used
by  these  institutions  to  attract  unrestricted  or  restricted  investment
accounts and to reinvest these funds in various activities.

Contract of Mudarabah
The basis for the rule that both parties to a Mudarabah contract must
  The basis for the rule that both parties to a Mudarabah contract must
be legally capable to appoint, or act as, an agent is because each party
acts as an agent of the other party and appoints the other party to act
on his behalf. The entitlement to appoint or act as an agent entitles one
to conclude a Mudarabah contract.
  The basis for regarding a Mudarabah contract initially as a non-bin-
The basis for regarding a Mudarabah contract initially as a non-bin-
ding contract is that the Mudarib is using the capital providers funds
with his consent in a contractual relationship in which the Mudarib is
just an agent, and an agency contract is not binding.
  The basis for making a Mudarabah contract binding once the work has
The basis for making a Mudarabah contract binding once the work has
commenced is that a unilateral termination of the contract at this stage
might frustrate the objective of the parties to make profit and might
cause damage to the Mudarib since he might not receive any compen-
sation for his work.
  The basis for allowing a time limit for the operation of a Mudarabah
The basis for allowing a time limit for the operation of a Mudarabah
contract is that a Mudarabah contract is, in essence, an agency contract,
which  is  subject  to  a  designated  duration.(9)(9)  The  International  Fiqh

with his consent, and the Mudarib and the owner of the funds share
the benefits from the use of the funds. In principle, a trustee should not
be held liable for losses sustained by the funds. Rather, the risks of such

  The basis for it being permissible that the capital of Mudarabah may
be  constituted  by  the  value  of  tangible  assets  contributed  is  that  the
objective of Mudarabah is to make profit. This objective can be realised
whether the capital is contributed in the form of tangible assets or cash.

  The basis for the requirement that the capital of Mudarabah should be
The basis for the requirement that the capital of Mudarabah should be
clearly known and should be defined in terms of quality and quantity
in a manner that eliminates any possibility of uncertainty or ambiguity
is  because  recognition  of  profit  is  dependent  on  the  recovery  of  the
capital on the date of liquidation. However, recovery of the capital can-
not be ascertained if its amount was not known earlier, and this lack of
knowledge may potentially lead to a dispute.
The basis for not allowing a debt owed by the Mudarib to the capital
  The basis for not allowing a debt owed by the Mudarib to the capital
provider be contributed as capital in a Mudarabah contract is because,
as  a  principle,  Mudarabah  capital  must  be  (at  the  conclusion  of
a Mudarabah contract) an asset that is available and cannot be used
on the spot for the Mudarabah operations. A debt fails to meet this
requirement, as it is a receivable that is not available for use when
the contract is concluded. Moreover, considering a debt as capital
of Mudarabah involves potential Riba. This is because the creditor
may be suspected of having extended the debt tenure in order to get
additional consideration (for the extension) from the debtor under
the name of Mudarabah.
  The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  Mudarabah  operation  is  valid
The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  Mudarabah  operation  is  valid
only if the capital is presented to the Mudarib is because the Mudarib is
the manager of the Mudarabah operation, and the trustworthy trustee
for the Mudarabah capital and income. Therefore, it is necessary that
the capital be fully released to the Mudarib so that he will be able to
protect and invest the capital and achieve the objective of the Mudarabah

Rules and Requirements Relating to Profit

  The basis for the requirement that the profit ratio is known is because
profit  is  the  subject  matter  of  a  Mudarabah  contract  and  a  lack  of
knowledge as to the subject matter renders a contract void.
  The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  profit  share  of  each  party  be
The  basis  for  the  requirement  that  the  profit  share  of  each  party  be
a percentage of the profit and not a lump sum is because a Mudarabah
contract is a form of partnership for sharing profit. Any condition that
allocates  a  lump  sum  to  one  party  would  not  be  consistent  with  the
sharing  of  profit.  This  is  because  the  Mudarabah  operation  may  not
realise a profit other than the lump sum which goes to one party, thus
excluding the other party from partnership in profit.
The basis for the impermissibility of simultaneously receiving a share
  The basis for the impermissibility of simultaneously receiving a share
of profit and a fee for managing a Mudarabah is likewise that the fee
is provided in the form of a lump sum and the Mudarabah operation
may not realise a profit other than the lump sum, thus precluding the
sharing of profit.
  The basis for the permissibility of an agreement to change the ratio of
The basis for the permissibility of an agreement to change the ratio of
profit distribution at any time is that the profit is a right belonging to
the parties and an agreement in the manner described does not lead
to a prohibited act, such as preclusion of sharing in profit. Rather, the
(14)
agreement makes the parties partners in profit.(14)
agreement makes the parties partners in profit.

  The  basis  for  nullifying  a  Mudarabah  contract  when  the  contract
is  silent  on  the  ratio  of  profit  distribution  and  there  is  no  customary
practice according to which the profit is to be distributed to each party
is that the subject matter of a Mudarabah contract is profit. The lack of
knowledge as to the subject matter nullifies contracts.
  The basis for nullifying a Mudarabah contract when one party sti-
The basis for nullifying a Mudarabah contract when one party sti-
pulates entitlement to a lump sum is because a Mudarabah is about
sharing profit and this form of condition precludes sharing of profit
and may potentially lead to one party being wrongfully deprived of
his rights.

this is the principle.

entailing the termination of the Mudarabah contract.

Definitions
Sharikah
Sharikah is an agreement between two or more parties to merge their
assets or to combine their services, obligations and liabilities with the aim
of making profit.
A Mudarabah contract is distinguished from a Sharikah (Musharakah)
contract in the following respects:
a) The basis for earning a share of profit in Sharikah is the required capital
contribution of all parties, whether in the form of cash, commodities,
services or liability in the case of reputation partnership and that the
subject of the contract is based on a single element, i.e. capital. The
basis for earning a profit in a Mudarabah, on the other hand, comes
from two elements: the first element is the existence of capital that
is subject to, and similar to, the conditions of Sharikah capital; the
second  element  is  the  work  done  by  the  Mudarib  that  is  different
from the capital of the venture.
b) In Sharikah, the work, as a general rule, is to be done jointly by the
parties, whereas in Mudarabah it is the Mudarib who works.

Statement of the Standard
1. 1. Scope of the Standard
Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  documentary  credit  extended  by  an  Institution,
either on the basis of client orders or for the use of the institution itself,
including all types and forms of documentary credit, the various stages
of their execution and the relationships created between the parties to
the transaction.
2. 2. Definition, Types and Characteristics of Documentary Credit
Definition, Types and Characteristics of Documentary Credit
2/1  Definition of documentary credit
  A documentary credit is a written undertaking by a bank (known
as the issuer) given to the seller (the beneficiary) as per the buyers
(applicants or orderers) instruction or is issued by the bank for its
own use, undertaking to pay up to a specified amount (in cash or
through  acceptance  or  discounting  of  a  bill  of  exchange),  within
a certain period of time, on condition that the seller presents docu-
ments for the goods conforming to the instructions.
In brief, a documentary credit is an undertaking by a bank to pay sub-
ject to conformity of the documents to the contractual instructions.
2/2  Procedural stages of documentary credit
2/2/1 The stage of concluding a credit contract: This stage precedes
credit, and the contract concluded is usually a sale contract
in which the seller stipulates that the price be paid through
documentary  credit,  however,  the  contract  may  be  a  lease
contract, agency with commission or any other contract.
2/2/2 The stage of requesting the opening of credit: At this stage the
buyer requests the bank to open the credit so that the seller
can be notified.
396396
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
2/2/3 The stage of issuing credit and notifying the seller: At this stage,
the bank issues and sends the letter of documentary credit to
the buyer, either directly or through an intermediary bank.
2/2/4 The stage of executing the credit: At this stage, the beneficiary
presents the documents stipulated in the letter of credit to the
bank. The bank examines them in accordance with the credit
conditions. If the documents conform to instructions, the bank
accepts them, executes the credit and delivers the documents to
the buyer, in case it is not the institution itself, after the receipt
of  partial  or  full  payment  of  the  value  or  receives  a  deed  of
commitment to pay on the date of maturity so that the buyer is
able to receive the goods represented by the documents. If the
documents do not conform to instructions, the bank reserves
the right to accept, reject or seek amendment of the documents.
2/2/5  Coverage by correspondents: If more than one bank participate
in the execution of credit, the accounts are settled in accordance
with the terms of coverage agreed upon between the banks.
2/3  Types of documentary credit
2/3/1  Basic classification
Documentary  credit  is  classified,  according  to  the  strength
of the undertaking into two types; namely (I) revocable cred-
it,  which  can  be  amended  or  cancelled  without  consulting
the  beneficiary,  and  (II)  irrevocable  credit,  which  cannot  be
amended or cancelled without the consent of the parties.
2/3/3 Other classifications
There are other classifications of documentary credit. These
include the following:
Transferable documentary credit: This credit entitles the benefi-

ciary to request the executing bank to make the credit available,

Standby credit (guarantee credit). This credit resembles letters

2/4 Characteristics of documentary credit
2/4/1 Dealing in documentary credit takes place on the basis of the
documents alone and is executed without reference to the goods.
Documentary credit, in essence, makes it binding for the bank
to execute the credit whenever the beneficiary presents, within
the  duration  of  the  validity  of  the  contract,  the  documents
required by the credit and conforming to the instructions.
2/4/2 Opening  of  credit  by  the  buyer  (orderer),  though  it  may  be
acted upon with certainty, is not considered a final payment of
the price of the goods. The buyer remains liable for the payment
however, the

398398
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
seller  (beneficiary)  does  not  have  a  right  to  request  payment
from the buyer as long as the credit subsists and is valid. If the
credit expires before the submission of the documents, the seller
has the right to claim payment directly from the buyer, because
expiry of the credit in itself does not amount to revocation of
the sale contract.
2/4/3 The bank is obliged to pay the value of the credit to the ben-
eficiary when the latter presents the documents that conform
to instructions, except upon proof of fraud or forgery of the
documents, or in the case of a court decision declaring the sale
contract null and void.
2/4/4 Interpretation  of  the  duties  and  obligations  of  the  parties  to
documentary credit are subject to International Commercial
Terms  (INCOTERMS  2000)  and  the  Uniform  Customs  and
Practices for Documentary Credit (UCP 500) when reference
is made to INCOTERMS in the sale contract and to UCP in
documentary credit.
3. Shariah Ruling on Documentary Credit
3/1  Permissibility of documentary credit
3/1/1 Dealing  in  documentary  credit  includes  agency  for  providing
procedural services, the most important of which is the exam-
ination of documents, and the provision of institutional guaran-
tee to the importer. As both agency and guarantee contracts are
permissible, documentary credit becomes permissible subject to
the conditions stipulated in this standard.
3/1/2 Opening  of  all  types  of  documentary  credit,  its  issuance  and
confirmation, on the basis of the clients order or for the institution
itself,  are  permitted  to  an  Institution.  It  is  also  permissible  to
an institution to participate, or play an intermediary role, in such
dealings and to notify, amend or execute in any way such credit,
either for its own use or on behalf of another institution or bank,
according  to  the  available  forms  of  executing  documentary
credit, subject to item (3/1/3) below.
399399
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
3/1/3 It is not permissible for the institution to undertake transactions
in  documentary  credit,  in  accordance  with  what  is  stated  in
item (3/1/2), either for itself or on behalf of another as a client
or  institution  or  by  way  of  collaboration,  when  such  credit
pertains to goods that are prohibited by the Shariah, or is based
on a contract that is void or irregular (according to the Shariah)
due to vitiating conditions or includes interest, either charged
or paid, whether explicitly as in the case of loan upon payment
by the beneficiary of amounts not fully or partially covered in
similar credit, or impliedly, as in the case of discounts or trading
(payment)  on  bills  of  exchange  with  deferred  and  delayed
payments.
It  is  stipulated  for  the  permissibility  of  the  subject  of  docu-
mentary credit that the contract upon which reliance is placed
be  a  contract  that  is  valid  in  the  Shariah  insofar  as  its  ele-
ments, conditions and type of transaction, whether currency
exchange,  ordinary  sale  or  another,  are  concerned,  and  also
with respect to its specific additional conditions.
3/1/4 The  bank  is  obliged  to  execute  the  credit  when  it  conforms
to instructions, except upon proof of fraud or forgery of the
documents, in which case it is under no obligation to execute
it.  Provided  that  if  the  contract  concluded  prior  to  opening
of  documentary  credit  is  nullified  by  a  court  decision,  the
execution of the credit is subject to a new agreement.
3/2  The contract preceding the opening of credit
3/2/1  It is permissible for the seller to stipulate in the sale contract that
payment be made through documentary credit. Such a condi-
tion is valid and its performance is binding upon the buyer.
3/2/2 It  is  permissible  to  secure  international  transactions  using
documentary  credit  provided  that  the  secured  transactions
do not violate the rules of the Shariah.
400400
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
3/2/3 When  the  contract  stipulates  that  its  interpretation  is
subject to INCOTERMS (issue 2000) or the United Nations
Convention in respect of the International sale of goods or
any  other  reference,  then  such  potential  interpretation  is
circumscribed with a condition that it must not violate the
rules of the Shariah. [see item 3/2/2]
3/3  Commissions and expenses in documentary credit
3/3/1 It is permissible for the institution to charge actual expenses
incurred in issuing documentary credit. It is also permissible
for the institution to charge a fee for providing the required
services, whether such a fee is in the form of a lump sum or
a certain percentage of the credit amount, provided that the
duration of the credit is not considered in determining the
commission. This rule applies to services rendered for both
import and export credit, except where the amendment in-
volves a rescheduling of the duration of the credit facility. It
is, therefore, permissible for the institution to charge only the
actual expenses incurred, in which case it will be a definite
sum and not a percentage.
The Institution must abide by the following conditions:
a) The aspect of guarantee per se must not be taken into account
when  estimating  fees  for  documentary  credit.  Accordingly,
it is not permissible for an institution to charge an amount
in  addition  to  the  actual  expenses  incurred  if  it  endorses
a  credit  facility  issued  by  another  bank,  because  endorsing
a  credit  facility  is  an  addition  over  guarantee.  The  rule  for
endorsement  applies  to  participation  in  the  issuance  and
endorsement  of  credit  as  well  as  issuance  of  standby  credit
(guarantee credit), as long as services or obligations are not
required.
b) The issuance of a credit facility should not involve Riba bear-
ing profits or become a means for such profits.
401401
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
c) It  is  not permissible to  use a combination of contracts in
c) It  is  not  permissible  to  use  a  combination  of  contracts  in
documentary  credit  as  an  excuse  for  involvement  in  the
prohibited  transactions,  such  as  taking  a  commission  for
providing a guarantee or extending a loan.
3/3/2 The  rule  of  item  3/3/1  above  equally  applies  to  receiving  or
payment  of  commissions  and  expenses  and  in  a  situation
where the institution acts as an intermediary in these respects,
irrespective of whether the transaction is between the institu-
tion and its client (the orderer or beneficiary) or between the
institution and other institutions and banks.
3/3/3 The  ruling  of  commission  for  providing  letters  of  guarantee
that was stated in the Shariah Standard No. (5) on Guarantees
must be applied when determining commissions for the letters
of  guarantee  that  accompany  documentary  credits,  such  as
letters of guarantee provided in the case of advance payment
of a portion of the amount or the shipping guarantee that is
issued for releasing the goods before the arrival of documents.
3/4  Guarantees in documentary credits
3/4/1  It  is  permissible  for  the  institution  to  secure  the  obligations
arising out of documentary credit, or to provide documentary
credit as security for payment in favour of institutions and banks
dealing with it. The institution may act as an intermediary for
facilitating  documentary  credit  using  other  permissible  and
acceptable  forms  of  guarantee.  It  is,  therefore  permissible
to  use  a  number  of  means  as  a  cover  for  documentary  credit
including cash, freezing of permissible accounts and negotiable
instruments valid according to the Shariah, certificates of shares
in real estate and withholding the documents of the credit that
stand for the goods.
The  cover  of  a  documentary  credit  may  be  also  one  of  the
following: a transferable letter of credit; a back-to-back letter of
credit; a letter of guarantee issued by the bank of the beneficiary
402402
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
against  the  advance  payment  in  case  of  advanced  payment
credits;  a  letter  of  guarantee  issued  by  a  bank  participating
in  the  issuance  or  confirmation  of  the  credit;  relinquishment
receivables and commercial papers, such as bill of exchange and
promissory  notes.  This  item  must  be  read  together  with  item
3/4/2 below.
3/4/2 It is not permissible for the institution to accept the following
types of guarantees: interest-based bonds, shares of companies
that deal in prohibited activities, and interest-based receivables.
It  is  also  not  permissible  for  the  institution  to  provide  any
of  these  guarantees  as  security  for  its  obligation  to  other
institutions or banks or to act as an intermediary to facilitate
such guarantees.
3/4/3 It  is  permissible  for  the  institution  and  the  applicant  for
documentary credit to agree on investing the cash cover of the
credit in accordance with Mudarabah partnership.
3/5  Murabahah transactions in documentary credit
  When a client intends to purchase imported goods from the institu-
tion through Murabahah financing of the documentary credit, the
following must be observed:
3/5/1 Opening  of  documentary  credit  should  not  precede  the
conclusion of the sale contract between the orderer and the
beneficiary  (the  seller)  irrespective  of  the  orderer  having
taken possession of the goods that are the subject-matter of
the contract.

 Brief History of
 the Preparation of the Standard
In  its  meeting  No.  (5)  held  in  Makkah  Al-Mukarramah  during  the
period of 8-12 Ramadan 1421 A.H., corresponding to 4-8 December 2000
A.D.,  the  Shariah  Board  resolved  to  give  priority  to  the  preparation  of
a Shariah Standard on Documentary Credit.
On  Monday  29  Ramadan  1421  A.H.,  corresponding  to  25  December
2000 A.D., a Shariah consultant was commissioned to prepare a Shariah
study and an exposure draft.
In its meeting held in the Kingdom of Bahrain on 15 and 16 Safar 1422
A.H.,  corresponding  to  9  and  10  May  2001  A.D.,  the  Shariah  Studies
Committee  discussed  the  juristic  study  of  the  standard  and  requested
the  consultant  to  incorporate  the  necessary  amendments  in  the  light  of
the conclusions of the Committee and the observations of members. The
Committee also discussed the exposure draft in its 10th meeting held in
the Kingdom of Bahrain on 14 Rabi I, 1422 A.H., corresponding to 6 June
2001 A.D., and made some amendments to the exposure draft.
In  its  meeting  No.  (11)  held  in  Jordan  on  18  and  19  Jumada  II,  1422
A.H., corresponding to 6-7 September 2001 A.D., the committee further
discussed the exposure draft of the standard and made amendments that
were deemed necessary in preparation of the submission to Shariah Board.
The revised exposure draft of the standard was presented to the Shariah
Board  in  its  8th  meeting  held  in  Al-Madinah  Al-Munawwarah  from  28
Safar to 4 Rabi I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 1116 May 2002 A.D. The
Shariah  Board  made  further  amendments  to  the  exposure  draft  and
decided to defer its discussion in the public hearing until views crystallize

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Permissibility of Documentary Credit
The permissibility of documentary credit is based on the principle that
it  relies  upon  contracts  that  are  valid  according  to  the  Shariah,  such  as
Kafalah (personal guarantee), Wakalah (agency contract) and Qard (loan).
Shariah Categorization of Documentary Credit
  The basis for the permissibility of irrevocable documentary credit is
The basis for the permissibility of irrevocable documentary credit is
a combination of a contract of guarantee and agency. To these two

the Qard (loan) transaction is to be added. It derives permissibility
the Qard (loan) transaction is to be added. It derives
from  the  contract  of  mortgage  (Rahn)  as  well,  because  it  secures
payment. The contract of guarantee creates a liability for payment,
while agency determines the performance of acts relating to oper-
ations such as communication of the credit notification and initia-
tion of operations pertaining to follow-up and examination of doc-
ument. The loan element comes into operation when the institution
pays  on  behalf  of  the  client  in  case  of  documentary  credit  that  is
totally or partially uncovered.(2)(2)
totally or partially uncovered.
  The basis for the permissibility of a revocable documentary credit is that
The basis for the permissibility of a revocable documentary credit is that
it is a form of agency contract that is permitted by the Shariah. When
a third partys right is attached to it, it becomes binding, and this occurs
when  it  leads  to  acceptance  or  payment.  A  revocable  documentary
credit  cannot  be  classified  under  the  contract  of  guarantee  for  two
reasons; namely (I) it conflicts with the requirements of guarantee; and
(II) an option is not permissible in guarantee contracts.(3)(3)

The  basis  for  the  ruling  that  documentary  credit  terminates  with

objectives of the contract.

The basis for the permissibility of making opening of documentary
credit a condition in the sale contract preceding documentary credit

an interest for the contract.
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  undertaking  international  sale
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  undertaking  international  sale
contracts and their security through documentary credit is that upon
examination, the international sale contracts that are secured through
documentary  credit  pose  a  difficulty:  Do  they  involve  delay  of  the
two counter-values that is prohibited by the Shariah?

Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
The members of the Board differed on this into those who prohibit them
due to the cause indicated, and those who permit them -being in a majority
with those permitting them disagreeing on the following points:
a) That these contracts -prior to the ascertainment of the goods- do not
involve delay in the two counter-values rather they amount to bilateral
promises, which are agreements to sell and do not amount to sale itself.
b) That they merely amount to extension of the session of the contract

e) That  the  contract  preceding  the  opening  of  documentary  credit
amounts to a sale contingent upon the opening of credit.
f) That these contracts do not involve delay in counter-values, because

collect from the client any interest at any stage of the credit (for discounting and
trading in commercial papers, see item 2/8 where the resolution provides the Shariah
basis for this ruling). As regards commission for providing the facility, the facility is
preparatory to extending a loan, and hence if commission is prohibited for giving the
loan itself it would be obviously correct to prohibit commission for a mere readiness
to do so. This conclusion has been adopted in the Al Baraka 8thth Forum in its Fatwa
to do so. This conclusion has been adopted in the Al Baraka 8
 Forum in its Fatwa
No. (13) and the response of the Shariah advisor to Dallah Albaraka Group No. (1).

Definitions
Credit Documents
These are the documents relating to goods detailed in the credit. The
documents are divided into two types: basic and additional documents.
Basic documents include: Shipping documents, commercial invoice, ma-
rine  insurance  policy,  certificate  of  origin,  consulate  invoice  and  prom-
issory  note.  Additional  documents  include:  Weights  certificate,  analysis
certificate, review and inspection certificate, warehouse receipts, delivery
orders,  packing  review/supervision  certificate,  test  certificate,  medical
certificate and non-infection certificate. Such certificates are requested to
verify certain attributes and characteristics of the commodity and to make
sure that it is free of defects and infection. The certificates are required by
the authorities of the importing or exporting country.
Bill of Lading

indicates  the  party  authorized  to  receive  the  goods,  whether  it  is  the
original beneficiary,
a party in whose name the bill is backed as a collateral
original beneficiary, a party in whose name the bill is backed as a collateral
arrangement or an agent assigned to receive the goods. A bill of lading
constitutes the practical execution of the shipping contract signed between
the  shipper  and  the  marine  carrier.  Shipping  is  the  responsibility  of  either
the buyer or of the seller according to the type of International Sale Contract
(Commercial Terms) adopted. A bill of lading is the only shipping document
that can be backed.
Examination of Documents
It is the process of ensuring that the documents comply with the spec-
ifications  indicated  in  the  letter  of  credit.  The  general  conditions  for  the
integrity of documents are detailed through the following four conditions:

  That the documents are submitted during the validity of the credit.
That they are complete in number.
  That they are complete in number.
  That they are complimentary and one document does not contradict
That they are complimentary and one document does not contradict
another and that each contains the required information or each serves
its function.
That they conform to the conditions of the letter of credit.
  That they conform to the conditions of the letter of credit.
In case any of these conditions is missing, for any one of these documents,
it  is  obligatory  upon  the  bank  to  reject  the  documents  as  a  whole,  even
those that are not defective.
At Sight Credit
It is credit that has to be paid promptly at sight according to the value
of the documents, by the issuing bank, the confirming bank or the paying
bank, if the documents conform to the conditions of the credit.
Deferred Payment Credit
It is an undertaking given by the issuing, or confirming bank to pay at
a future date, being the date fixed in the credit, the value of the documents
if they conform to the conditions of the credit. It differs from acceptance
credit insofar as the beneficiary does not present a promissory note with
the documents.
Acceptance Credit
It is the acceptance of the bill of exchange attached to the documents or
is signed on behalf of the bank; that is, the bank accepts the obligation of
paying the nominal value on the date of maturity.
Negotiation of Documents
It is the payment of the value of the documents, or the purchase of the
bill of exchange attached to them; that is, its discounting, whether it is to be
paid at sight or after a known specified period.
Acceptance of Documents Under Reserve
It occurs when the bank chooses to accept the documents at its own risk
despite their non-conformance with the conditions of the credit, paying their
value or accepting the bill of exchange attached to them, on the condition that
416416
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
it reserves the right of recourse to the beneficiary if the issuing bank does not
accept the discrepancies in the documents. The paying bank usually reserves
this right by way of obtaining a letter of guarantee, covering the value of the
documents, from the bank of the beneficiary.
Marine Letter of Guarantee
It  is  an  undertaking  given  by  the  issuing  bank  to  place  the  original
bill  of  lading,  when  received,  at  the  disposal  of  the  carrier  in  lieu  of
receiving back a letter from him. The carrier in this case is relieved from
all  responsibility  that  may  arise  from  the  delivery  of  the  goods  to  the
importer, who gives an undertaking to the issuing bank for the acceptance
of the documents regardless of any discrepancies in them. This type of
letter is usually issued upon arrival of the goods when the documents are
to follow or are delayed.
Correspondent Bank
It is the bank assigned by the issuing bank to notify the beneficiary of
the  credit.  As  a  rule,  the  correspondent  bank  is  under  no  obligation  to
pay the value of the credit; its role is confined to that of an intermediary.
Correspondent banks are banks with which the institution makes certain
arrangements for accepting or covering the value of the credits that it issues
or confirms.
In case the beneficiary requests notification through a non-correspondent
bank,  the  issuing  bank  sends  its  instructions  to  one  of  its  correspondent
banks asking it to process the notification through the bank nominated by
the beneficiary.
Confirmation of Credit
It is the merging of the liability of the confirming bank with the liability
of the issuing bank making both banks liable for fulfilling the conditions
of payment of credit, when the beneficiary presents documents that meet
the  terms  of  the  credit.  The  beneficiary  has  the  right  to  claim  payment
severally from either bank or jointly from both banks.
The Paying Bank
It  is  a  correspondent  bank  of  the issuing  bank  in  the  currency  of  the
It  is  a  correspondent  bank  of  the  issuing  bank  in  the  currency  of  the
credit to whom the issuing bank entrusts the payment of the value of the
417417
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
credit on its behalf, but the paying bank is under no obligation for executing
this trust.
The Covering Bank
Covering banks are types of correspondent banks with which the bank
maintains  an  account  and  to  whom  it  delegates  the  authority  to  cover
disbursement and negotiation payments upon the first presentation.
Transferable Credit
It  is  irrevocable  credit  by  means  of  which  the  beneficiary  (first  benefi-
ciary) requests the bank assigned, or any other licensed institution, to make
payment  or  to  undertake  to  pay  in  the  future  or  to  accept  or  to  negotiate
so as to make the credit available, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary or
beneficiaries.
Back to Back Credit
It is irrevocable credit issued for the same purpose as that of transferable
credit whenever a credit is not transferable.
Revolving Credit
It is credit that is opened for a fixed value and duration, except that its
value is renewed automatically when it is executed or utilised so as to enable
the beneficiary to present documents for a new operation within the value
of the credit, during the period of its validity, and for the number of times
fixed for the credit.
Advance Credit or Red Clause Credit
It is credit bearing a paragraph written in red ink to invite attention to
its instructions. In this credit, the authorised bank is assigned to pay certain
amount according to percentage of the value of the credit to the beneficiary
in  advance  before  the  goods  are  shipped  and  before  the  documents  that
necessitate payment are presented.
Credit Available for Negotiation
This is credit by which the issuing bank grants to the correspondent bank
the legal authority to buy bills of exchange drawn on the basis of documentary
418418
Shariah Standard No. (14): Documentary Credit
credit  upon  presentation  of  bills  of  exchange  that  are  payable  at  sight  by
the issuing bank or are payable in the future to the issuer of documentary
credit. Accordingly, the seller is able to receive the value of the credit (bills of
exchange) upon presentation of required complete documents that obligate
payment of the value of the credit.

All praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, and blessings and peace be
upon our master, Muhammad, and his household and all his companions
Preface
The purpose of this standard is to elaborate the definition of Jualah, to
distinguish it from Ijarah, to describe its elements, conditions, legal status
in the Shariah, fundamental rules, and applications in the transactions of
Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions),(1)(1) irrespective of the
Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions),
 irrespective of the
institution  acting  as  the  general  offeror  (demanding  performance)  or  as
the worker (under an obligation to perform), even when this is through
another, parallel Jualah.
 The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial

Shariah Standard No. (15): Jualah
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard sets out fundamental rules of the Shariah on Jualah and its
application in activities for which the extent of the work required cannot
be  precisely  determined  for  it  continues  throughout  the  determined
period. It is for this reason that it does not cover the contract of Ijarah
for employment/service or leasing, just as it does not cover maintenance
contracts or stipulations of maintenance in relation to other contracts,
such as the requirement of maintenance in a sale contract or an Istisnaa
contract (construction contract).
2. 2. Definition of Jualah
Definition of Jualah
Jualah is a contract in which one of the parties (the Jail) offers spec-
ified  compensation  (the  Jul)  to  anyone  (the  Amil)  who  will  achieve
a determined result in a known or unknown period.
3. 3. Permissibility of Jualah
Permissibility of Jualah
Jualah  is  permissible  deeming  the  determination  of  the  end  result  to  be
realised through it as sufficient, and it is not affected by the uncertainty that
prevails with respect to the subject-matter of the contract, that is, the work
to be done. It is for this reason that Jualah is suitable for activities for which
Ijarah, which requires that the desired work be clearly specified, is not.
4. Shariah Status of Jualah
4/1  With due consideration to item (6) below in respect to the revocation
of Jualah, Jualah, in principle, is not a binding contract. The general
offeror (Jail) or the worker (Amil) are entitled to revoke it unilaterally,
however, it becomes binding for the Jail when the worker commences
work.  If  the  worker  undertakes  not  to  revoke  the  contract  during
a specified period, it is binding on him to abide by the undertaking.
426426
Shariah Standard No. (15): Jualah
4/2  The  possession  of  the  worker  exercised  over  the  property  of  the
offeror is that of a trustee. He is, therefore, not liable except in the case
of negligence, misconduct or violation of the conditions stipulated by
the offeror.
5. Elements of Jualah and Its Conditions
  The elements of Jualah are: The two parties (the offeror and the worker),
the  form  of  the  contract  and  the  subject-matter  of  the  contract  (the
compensation and the work).
5/1  The two parties to the contract (the offeror and the worker)
  The existence of legal capacity is a condition for both parties to the
contract. It is not a condition that the worker be specified, therefore,
Jualah  is  concluded  by  the  issuance  of  an  offer  directed  at  the
general public. Any person whom the offer reaches may undertake
the work himself or with the help of another. If, however, the worker
is specified, it is obligatory for him to undertake the work himself or
with the express consent of the offeror through someone under his
supervision and control.
5/2  Form of the contract
  The  Jualah  contract  is  concluded  by  an  offer  directed  towards
a  specified  worker  or  towards  the  general  public,  irrespective  of
such an offer being made verbally, in writing or through any other
means  that  indicate  an  invitation  to  work  and  an  obligation  to
pay the compensation. Acceptance of the offer is not stipulated as
a condition.
5/3  The subject matter of the contract (compensation and work)
  The subject matter of the contract is the work that is agreed upon
through Jualah as well as the compensation for the work.
5/3/1 Work that produces the desired result
5/3/1/1 Among the forms of activity that may be agreed upon
on the basis of the Jualah contract are the following:
a)  An activity that is intended, through the agreement,
to produce a result such as the extraction of minerals.
427427
Shariah Standard No. (15): Jualah
b)  Any information in which the offeror has an interest
such as presenting a report or study or the completion
of scientific works that realise a result, but in which
the extent of the work cannot be determined.
c)  An activity that is intended, through the agreement,
to return lost property to its seeker.
5/3/1/2 It is permissible to stipulate that the job is done within
a specified period so that the worker will not be entitled
to  compensation  after  this  period,  except  when  the
period is over and the result is close to realisation, in
which case the period will be automatically extended.
5/3/1/3 When the period is over and the worker has done (part
of) the work that will benefit the offeror, the worker is
entitled to reasonable wages (Ujrat al-Mithl
entitled to reasonable wages (
Ujrat al-Mithl).).
5/3/1/4 The  Jualah  contract  is  valid  despite  uncertainty  as  to
the nature of the work, provided that the required result
realised by the work is determined.
5/3/1/5 It is a condition that the work involves some type of
effort.
5/3/1/6 It is a condition that the work not be obligatory for the
worker.
5/3/2 The compensation
5/3/2/1 The compensation should be known, valuable in the
eyes of the Shariah, and deliverable. If the compensation
is unknown, unlawful or not deliverable, payment of
reasonable compensation becomes binding.
5/3/2/2 The compensation may be a portion of the object of
work  in  Jualah,  for  instance,  a  percentage  of  a  debt
agreed upon for collection or the right to utilise, for
 a determined period, a project whose implementation
is agreed upon.
428428
Shariah Standard No. (15): Jualah
5/3/2/3 As a rule, entitlement to compensation is not estab-
lished  until  the  work  is  completed  and  delivered  to
the  offeror.  The  following  are  the  exceptions  to  the
rule:
a)  Where it is evident that the work undertaken by the
worker belongs to someone other than the offeror
and has been decreed as such, the worker is entitled
to the compensation.
b)  Where an accident occurs during work undertaken
by  the  worker  causing  loss  that  was  not  due  to
the tort or negligence of the worker, the worker is
entitled to full compensation.
5/3/2/4 It  is  permissible  to  stipulate  that  all  or  part  of  the
compensation be paid in advance at the conclusion of
the contract or thereafter, even though this is before
the completion of the entire work, however, it is con-
sidered  subject  to  accounts  and  the  worker  is  not
entitled to it without the realisation of the result, the
offeror having the right to reclaim it if the work is not
realised.
6. Revocation of Jualah
6/1  If the offeror, or the worker, revokes the contract prior to the com-
mencement of work, the worker is not entitled to compensation.
6/2  If the offeror prevents the worker from working after commencement
of the work, the offeror is bound to pay reasonable wages.
6/3  If  Jualah  contract  is  terminated  by  the  worker  after  the  work  is
commenced; the worker is not entitled to a reward, except when
the parties agree to otherwise.
6/4  If the worker revokes the contract after commencing the work, he
has no claim against the offeror, unless they had agreed to the con-
trary.
429429
Shariah Standard No. (15): Jualah
7. Distinction between Jualah and Ijarah
Jualah is distinguished from Ijarah on the following grounds:
7/1  Jualah is valid despite uncertainty of work deeming the determination
of the required result by the offeror as sufficient.
7/2  Jualah does not require acceptance.
7/3  Entitlement to compensation depends on completion of work and
delivery of result.
7/4  Jualah is valid even if the other party is not known.
7/5  As a rule, Jualah is terminable, while Ijarah is binding.
8. 8. Applications of Jualah
Applications of Jualah
  Among the applications of Jualah in activities where the extent of work
is undetermined and in which uncertainty is overlooked are:
8/1  Exploration for minerals and extraction of water
Jualah  contract  may  be  used  for  the  exploration  for  minerals  and
the extraction of water in situations where entitlement to wages is
contingent upon the finding of minerals or water without reference
to the amount of time or the extent of the period.
8/2  Collection of debts
Jualah is used for collecting debts in cases where the entitlement to
compensation is contingent upon the collection of all of the debt, in
which case entitlement to the entire compensation is established, or
part of the debt so that compensation proportionate to the amount
of debt collected is due.
8/3  Securing permissible financing facilities
8/3/1 Securing permissible financing facilities means that the worker
undertakes  some  work  that  leads  the  institution  to  agree  to
the granting of financing facilities to the offeror or to arrange
syndicated financing.
8/3/2 Jualah  contract  may  be  used  for  securing  facilities  provided
that the condition of the permissibility of Jualah is met, that is,
430430
Shariah Standard No. (15): Jualah
the subject-matter of Jualah must be valid such as the creation
of debt through Murabahah on deferred payment, Ijarah with
deferred  rental, raising of loans without interest, issuance of
deferred  rental,  raising  of  loans  without  interest,  issuance  of
letters  of  guarantee  or  the  opening  of  documentary  credit
with the condition that the transactions are not employed for
raising interest bearing loans through stipulations, customary
practice or dealings among institutions.
8/4  Brokerage
Jualah is used in brokerage activities in cases where the entitlement
to compensation is contingent upon the conclusion of the contract
for which intermediation is undertaken.
8/5  Discoveries, inventions and designs
Jualah is used for the realisation of scientific discoveries, innovative
inventions  and  designs,  such  as  symbols  and  trade  marks,  where
entitlement  to  compensation  is  contingent  upon  the  realisation  of
the discoveries, the registration of patents or the creation of designs
conforming to the conditions elaborated by the offeror.
9. Role of Institutions in Jualah
9/1  It is permissible for an institution to have the status of a worker in
Jualah  by  contract,  for  work  benefiting  others  irrespective  of  the
institution  undertaking  the  work  itself  or  by  contracting  out  the
work through another Jualah that is in the nature of a parallel, unless
it is stipulated that the institution will carry out the work itself. It is
obligatory that the two Jualahs are not linked.
9/2  It is permissible for an institution to have the status of the offeror
whether the work benefits the institution or is for the fulfilment of
its obligation in a Jualah for the benefit of another (parallel Jualah)
ensuring that the two Jualahs are not linked.

  As for Ijtihad (reasoning), there is a general need for Jualah in the case
of acts that cannot be performed by a person himself nor can he find
someone who will volunteer for him. Further, it is suitable for cases for
which the contract of Ijarah is not suitable, like the return of lost prop-
erty from an unknown location.

it resembles bequest, which is not binding. The basis for Jualah being
non-binding for the worker is that the work to be done is uncertain,
thus, it resembles Mudarabah, which is not binding.
   The basis for regarding Jualah as binding when the worker has commenced
The basis for regarding Jualah as binding when the worker has commenced
work is that at this stage Jualah is similar to Mudarabah in which the
Mudarib has commenced work. Like Mudarabah, Jualah is considered
binding by the Maliki scholars in such a case. The basis for considering
it binding when the two parties undertake not to terminate the contract
during the period of the contract is that unilateral revocation leads to the
loss of the effort put in by the worker or the likelihood of injury for the
offeror.
The basis for the entitlement of the worker to receive reasonable wages,
  The basis for the entitlement of the worker to receive reasonable wages,
when the contract is revoked after commencement of work, is that the
work done by the worker is legally valid and loss is not to be caused to
him. He, therefore, has recourse to reasonable compensation as is the
case in Ijarah when it is revoked due to a defect.
Elements of Jualah and Its Conditions
The basis for the rule that it is obligatory in Jualah that all its elements
   The basis for the rule that it is obligatory in Jualah that all its elements
(two  parties,  form,  work  and  compensation)  be  found  is  that  it  is
a contract and must have these elements. Further, Jualah is a commutative
contract that must have a form to indicate the task required as well as the
amount of compensation.
   The basis for permitting the worker to seek assistance from others, when
The basis for permitting the worker to seek assistance from others, when
there is no stipulation for his personal services, is that Jualah is similar to
agency in which seeking help from others is valid.
  The  basis  for  not  stipulating  the  identification  of  the  worker  and
The  basis  for  not  stipulating  the  identification  of  the  worker  and
directing the offer towards the general public is that the offeror does
not know of a person who is able to achieve what is required.
The basis for not stipulating acceptance on the part of the worker, when
   The basis for not stipulating acceptance on the part of the worker, when
he is unknown, is that it is not possible to obtain his acceptance.

with the impossibility of determining the extent of work.

sation is like wages and that there is no need to validate Jualah when

The basis for recourse to reasonable compensation upon the vitiation
of the named compensation is analogy constructed upon Ijarah with
recourse to reasonable wages upon the vitiation of the named wages.
  The basis for the permissibility of compensation being a portion of the
The basis for the permissibility of compensation being a portion of the
subject-matter of Jualah, even though it is uncertain and does not ex-
ist, is that it is a type of uncertainty that does not prevent delivery and
involves no Gharar (uncertainty) since entitlement to compensation is
not established until the task is accomplished.
  The basis for the rule that entitlement to compensation is not established
The basis for the rule that entitlement to compensation is not established
until the work is completed and delivered, is that work in Jualah is not
determined or certain, therefore, stipulating payment as compensation
would amount to compensating something that has not compensation
because the work has not been completed.
Applications of Jualah
  The basis for permitting an institution to undertake Jualah, as a worker
The basis for permitting an institution to undertake Jualah, as a worker
or as an offeror, is the permissibility of Jualah for which natural persons
and juristic persons have the same legal capacity.
   The basis for the permissibility of Jualah for debt collection, and other
The basis for the permissibility of Jualah for debt collection, and other
similar acts stated in the standard, is that these are acts whose precise
determination is difficult and Ijarah is not suitable for them, while Jualah
is legally valid despite the uncertainty with respect to work.

Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers commercial papers to which the Geneva Uniform
Convention on the Law of Commercial Papers,(2)(2) confined itself. These
 confined itself. These
Convention on the Law of Commercial Papers,
are bill of exchange, promissory note and cheque. This standard covers
dealings in such commercial papers insofar as they conform to the rules
and  principles  of  the  Shariah.  The  standard  does  not  cover  anything
that may possess the attributes of commercial paper other than the three
types named above.
2. Definition and Shariah Characterisation of Commercial Papers
2/1  Bill of exchange: A written, signed, and unconditional order from
a person to another person to pay a certain sum of money at sight
or at a particular or determinable date to a third person or to the
order of that third person or to the bearer of that order.
2/2  Promissory  note:  A  certificate  whereby  by  the  issuer  (a  debtor)
promises to pay a certain amount of money at sight or at a particular
or determinable date to another person (a beneficiary/creditor). In
Shariah characterisation, it is considered a certificate of debt.
2/3  Cheque: A certificate that is issued to a particular person, contain-
ing  an  order  issued  by  a  person  (the  drawer)  to  another  person
(the drawee) to pay a certain sum of money to a third person (the
beneficiary)  at  sight.  In  Shariah  characterisation,  it  is  considered
a restricted Hawalah if the drawer is a debtor to the drawee. Oth-
erwise, it is considered an unrestricted Hawalah with respect to the
drawer.

3. Rules for Dealing in Commercial Papers
3/1  It is permissible to undertake transactions in commercial paper of
the three types (bill of exchange, promissory note and cheque) on
the  condition  that  it  does  not  amount  to  the  contravention  of  the
Shariah, like Riba or delay that is legally prohibited in accordance
with the details provided in the following paragraphs.
3/2  It  is  not  permissible  to  use  a  bill  of  exchange  or  promissory  note
in transactions that require possession (of the counter-values), like
deeming the two types of commercial paper as counter-values in the
contract of
 (currency exchange) or as the counter-value for the
contract of SarfSarf (currency exchange) or as the counter-value for the
capital (Ras al-Mal
capital (
) in the contract of Salam.
Ras al-Mal) in the contract of Salam.
3/3  It is permitted to use a cheque in the following types of transactions
and situations:
a)  A  cheque,  where  the  owner  has  a  balance,  when  drawn  by  the
client  against  the  bank  or  by  the  bank  against  another  bank  or
against itself or against one of its branches.
b)  A cheque, where the owner has no balance, when drawn by the
b) A cheque, where the owner has no balance, when drawn by the
client  against  a  bank  or  is  drawn  by  the  bank  against  another
bank or against itself or against one of its branches (the so-called
overdraft). From Shariah perspective, it is a loan (Qard) which is
permissible if it is void of Riba.
c)  A crossed cheque that binds the payee bank to fulfil its conditions.
d)  An account payee cheque that binds payee bank to fulfil its conditions
by crediting the amount of the cheque to the beneficiarys account.
e)  Travellers cheques. It is permissible for the institution issuing it
to take commission in lieu of intermediation in such issuance or
at the time of its payment provided this does not include Riba.
4. Endorsement
  All forms of endorsements are binding with respect to their legal effects
provided that the endorsements fulfil the legal conditions and regulations
determined for them.

Shariah Standard No. (16): Commercial Papers
5. Collection of the Amount of Commercial Papers
  The collection of the amount of commercial papers is considered an agency
with the client appointing the institution as an agent to collect the value
of the paper on his behalf. The institution is entitled to commission that
is  agreed  upon  between  the  client  and  the  institution.  In  the  absence  of
an agreement between them, the practice prevalent among institutions is
to be acted upon.
6. Discounting of Commercial Papers
6/1  It is not permissible to discount commercial papers, but it is permitted
permitted
6/1  It is not permissible to discount commercial papers, but it is
to pay an amount that is less than the value of the paper to the first
beneficiary prior to the date of maturity.
6/2  It is not permissible to sell commercial paper that has not become due
) nor for an amount
Riba al-Nasi`ah) nor for an amount
 plus Riba al-Fadl
for an amount similar to its value (Riba al-Nasi`ah
for an amount similar to its value (
that is more than its value (Riba al-Nasi`ah
that is more than its value (
Riba al-Nasi`ah plus
Riba al-Fadl).).
6/3  It is permissible to the beneficiary to treat commercial paper that is
not yet due as price for ascertained goods or usufruct, but not those
that are sold by description as a liability with the condition of actual
or legal delivery of goods or usufructuary asset (commodity-based
discounting of debts).
6/4  The holder of commercial paper is permitted to purchase goods to
be delivered later (on the date of maturity of the paper), and after
the debt is established as a liability. The holder of the paper transfers
the claim of his creditor to his debtor through this paper. In such
a case, the transaction amounts to Hawalah.
7. Taking Possession of Commercial Papers
7/1  The receipt of a cheque requiring prompt payment, if it is a bankers
cheque or a certified cheque or one that is legally deemed a certified
cheques whereby a certain amount is mandatorily maintained in the
drawers account, being drawn among banks or among banks and
their  branches,  constitutes  constructive  possession  of  the  amount
written on it, and it is on this basis that it is permissible to use the
446446
Shariah Standard No. (16): Commercial Papers
cheque in transactions that stipulate possession such as the exchange
of currencies, the purchase of gold or silver with the cheque as well
as treating the cheque as capital (Ras al-Mal
as treating the cheque as capital (
) of Salam.
Ras al-Mal) of Salam.
7/2  The receipt of a cheque that is to be paid promptly, if it is not a bankers
cheque or a certified cheque or one that is legally deemed a certified
cheque, cannot be considered constructive possession of its amount,
and in such a case, it is not permitted to use it for transactions for
which possession is stipulated.
7/3  It  is  permitted  to  use  cheques  of  bank  transfers  for  transactions
when the amount intended to be transferred is in the same currency
in  which  payment  is  to  be  made,  however,  where  the  currency  is
different from that in which payment is to be made, it is necessary
to first apply the process of conversion between the two currencies,
deeming constructive possession to be sufficient, and then undertake
the  transfer.  It  is  a  form  combining  currency  exchange  (
)  and
the  transfer.  It  is  a  form  combining  currency  exchange  (SarfSarf)  and
Hawalah.
8. Acceptance for Payment of the Value of Commercial Papers
8/1  Acceptance for paying the value of commercial paper on the part of
the drawee is considered an undertaking and an obligation to pay
the debt represented by the commercial paper to the holder on the
date of maturity. This undertaking and obligation must be fulfilled
according to the Shariah.
8/2  All parties whose signatures appear on the commercial paper including
the drawer, the endorser and the guarantor are jointly responsible to
pay to the holder the value of the paper in accordance with rules of
liability, thus, the holder is entitled to have recourse to them severally
or  jointly  after  the  refusal  of  the  drawer  (or  the  issuer  in  case  of
a promissory note) to pay.
8/3  Tangible security stipulated by the holder of commercial paper to
ensure the securing of his right will be deemed a Mortgage (Rahn)
and will be governed by the rules of Mortgage (Rahn).

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Dealings in Commercial Papers
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  dealing  in  a  bill  of  exchange  is
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  dealing  in  a  bill  of  exchange  is
that it is in the meaning of Hawalah or Qard (loan) contract, which
are  agreed  upon  by  Ijma  (consensus  of  Fuqaha),  or  in  the  mea-
  (demand  note),  which  is  valid  according  to  the
Suftajah  (demand  note),  which  is  valid  according  to  the
ning  of  Suftajah
ning  of
preponderant  opinion.  The  evidence  for  this  is  the  report  from
a  number  of  Companions  (may  Allah  be  pleased  with  them)  who
dealt in these instruments. It is reported from Abdullah Ibn Abbas
(may Allah be pleased with him) that he used to take silver from tra-
ders at Mecca and write down a demand note for them to be paid at
Kufa. It is related from Abdullah Ibn Al-Zubayr that he used to take
dirhams  from  traders  at  Mecca  and  then  write  a  note  drawn  upon
his brother Musab in Iraq. When Ibn Abbas was asked about this, he

them. The lender is secure against the danger of the highway in trans-
porting his dirhams to the destined town, while the borrower benefits
from the loan and is also secure against the dangers of the highway
being under an obligation to pay in the said town. The Shariah does
not lay down a prohibition for interests that do no invoke harm.

without interest. Banks will not accept cheques drawn upon them by
clients with no balance except by charging Riba-bearing profits that are
due from the client along with the value of the cheque. Consequently,

stipulate.
 The reason is that such a condition promotes the inherent
interest of the contract. Further, the primary principle for conditions
and contracts is that of permissibility.

The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of endorsement  is  that  it  does  not  go
beyond the meaning of either Hawalah (transfer) or Wakalah (agency), and
both are permissible.

  The  basis  for  not  permitting  discounting  of  commercial  paper  is  that
in reality the discounting of commercial paper amounts to a loan with
interest. What affirms this is that the interest charged through discounting
varies  according  to  the  value  of  the  commercial  paper  and  its  date  of
maturity, and loan with interest is prohibited by agreement.

The permissibility of paying less than the value of the paper, when the
transaction  is  between  the  holder  and  the  first  beneficiary,  is  that  it

evidence that supports permissibility is the Hadith of Ibn Abbas (may

you have ordered our expulsion when we have against people debt claims
that are not yet due. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Reduce the
amounts to hasten payments.(9)(9) Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with
amounts to hasten payments.
 Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with
him), was asked about the issue of a person who has a deferred claim
against another, and he says to the debtor, Hasten the payment and I will
reduce the amount for you, so Ibn Abbas responded saying, There is no
harm in it. Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), was the narrator
of the previous Hadith. Further, this issue is the opposite of the issue of
RibaRiba. That is, Riba involves an excess in both the period and the amount,
. That is, Riba involves an excess in both the period and the amount,
which is entirely harmful for the debtor, whereas this issue involves the
absolving  of  the  liability  of  the  debtor  with  respect  to  the  debt  with
a benefit coming to the creditor through prompt payment. Each one of
them benefits without being subjected to harm. This is different from
, the prohibition of which is agreed upon and that causes injury to
RibaRiba, the prohibition of which is agreed upon and that causes injury to
the debtor. The benefit in Riba is exclusively for the creditor (owner of
capital). Thus, this case differs from Riba in both form and meaning. The
reason is that the excess in Riba as a counter-value for the period leads to
a grave hardship, for a single dirham is doubled and multiplied keeping
the  Dhimmah  (liability)  engaged  without  any  corresponding  benefit.
In the case of reduction of the amount and hastening of payment, the
liability of the debtor is removed and the prompt payment benefits the
creditor.  The  Law-giver  encourages  the  discharging  of  debt  liabilities.
The debtor has been called a person imprisoned by difficulties, and thus
in the discharging his liability is a release from these shackles. This is

different from his remaining patiently burdened with an excess.(10)

  The basis for treating commercial paper as a price for ascertained goods
The basis for treating commercial paper as a price for ascertained goods
is that it amounts to the sale of a debt, to a person other than the one
who owes it, for ascertained goods. This is permitted according to the
Maliki school if it takes place after possession so that it does not turn
into the delaying of the two counter-values. A resolution pertaining to
this has been issued by the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Organization
(11)
of Islamic Conference.(11)
of Islamic Conference.
 Taking Possession of Commercial Papers
  The basis for considering a cheque, whether certified or one of the same
The basis for considering a cheque, whether certified or one of the same
type, as possession of the amount mentioned in it, is that a cheque is
secured  by  a  large  number  of  guarantees  that  make  the  possessor  the
owner of its contents. The beneficiary in this case is able to undertake
transactions in it by selling, buying or by making a gift. Further, there is
a strong protection provided by state governments to support confidence
in cheques. In addition to this, relying upon a cheque means the existence
of sufficient funds to cover its amount with the certifier undertaking to
retain the funds until the end of the period fixed for payment. It is for
this reason that people in general prefer certified cheques over cash for
large transactions.
  The  basis  for  not  considering  an  uncertified  cheque,  or  one  that  is
The  basis  for  not  considering  an  uncertified  cheque,  or  one  that  is
similar to it as far as the possession of its amount is concerned, is the
probability that there is no balance to cover it or there is an insufficient
balance. The basis for possession is customary practice, and a resolution
has been passed by the Islamic Fiqh Academy deeming the receipt of
a certified cheque as possession.
  The basis for the permissibility of dealing in cheques for bank transfers,
The basis for the permissibility of dealing in cheques for bank transfers,

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  The basis for the permissibility of issuing investment certificates is that
The basis for the permissibility of issuing investment certificates is that
such  certificates  are  usually  issued  on  the  basis  of  Shariah-nominated
contracts. Hence issuance of Sukuk on the basis of any of these contracts
becomes acceptable as well.
   The basis for considering the issue prospectus as an offer and the fact
 The basis for considering the issue prospectus as an offer and the fact
of subscription as an acceptance is that valid contracts take place on the
basis of anything that indicates consent without specifying a particular
form of expression. It is thus not objectionable that an offer comes from
one person and acceptance from a large number of persons.
  The basis for the right of certificate holders to management is that they
The basis for the right of certificate holders to management is that they
own  the  property  that  their  certificates  represent,  and  management  is
part of ownership.
  The basis for permissibility of trading in investment Sukuk when such
The basis for permissibility of trading in investment Sukuk when such
Sukuk represent shares in tangible assets or usufruct is that the trading is,
in fact, on the assets and usufructs. Since these assets may be traded so
too the certificates that represent them.
  The basis for impermissibility of trading in Salam certificates is that the
The basis for impermissibility of trading in Salam certificates is that the
certificate represents a share in the Salam debt in which case the certifi-
cates is subject to rules of debt trading.
  The  basis  for  permissibility  of  trading  in  Istisnaa  certificates  after
The  basis  for  permissibility  of  trading  in  Istisnaa  certificates  after
conversion of the realized funds into assets is that such assets represent
properties that can be disposed of. The basis for the impermissibility
properties that can be disposed of.  The basis for the impermissibility
of trading in Istisnaa certificates in case of using the realized funds as
a price in a parallel Istisnaa and in case of delivering the manufactured
asset to the ultimate purchaser is that the certificate represents the price
in the liability of the purchaser. The price then is a monetary debt for
which trading of the Sukuk at this stage is subject to the rules of debt
trading.

  The basis for the impermissibility of trading in Murabahah certificates
The basis for the impermissibility of trading in Murabahah certificates
after  the  commodity  is  sold  and  delivered  to  the  buyer  is  that  the
certificates represent a monetary debt against the buyer, in which case
trading is not permissible except in accordance with the limitations of
debt trading. However, if purchase of the commodity has taken place
and is yet to be sold, trading in these certificates is permissible because
the certificates represent assets that can be traded.

Shariah Standard No. (18): Possession (Qabd)
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers possession in contracts and what acts as a constructive
substitute  for  it  (constructive  possession).  It  elaborates  the  mode  of  its
realisation in immovable and movable property as well as in things that
are  ascertained  and  those  established  as  a  liability  by  description.  The
standard also identifies the person responsible for its costs (maintenance
and  expenses)  in  various  types  of  contracts  along  with  their  modern
applications.
  The standard does not cover acts other than contracts, like possession in
usurpation (
) and the like. Further, it does not cover the nature of
usurpation (GhasbGhasb) and the like. Further, it does not cover the nature of
possession with respect to liability for compensation or otherwise, nor to
possession in set-offs, as these have their specific standards.
2. Definition of Possession
  Possession is the gathering of a thing or what takes its rule, according to
the requirements of customary practice.
3. Mode of Taking Possession
3/1  The basis for determining the mode of possession in things is custom
(Urf). It is for this reason that possession of things has differed in
accordance with the nature of things and differences among people
with respect to things.
3/2 Actual possession is realised in immovable property through relin-
quishment and enabling transactions in it.
3/3 Actual possession takes place in movables through physical corpore-
al delivery. Constructive possession, in ascertained movables as well
as in those established as a liability by description, takes place -after
their ascertainment by means of one of the methods known for their
494494
Shariah Standard No. (18): Possession (Qabd)
ascertainment- by relinquishing (releasing) the thing for the person
entitled  to  it  enabling  him  to  deliver  it  without  any  obstacle  even
when no transportation or transmission has taken place. This takes
place  irrespective  of  the  thing  being  one  that  is  acquired  by  hand
in practice or is one in which delivery (transmission) is stipulated
through  one  of  the  customary  units  of  measure  -cubic  measure,
weight or linear measure- or it is a commodity to which these mea-
sures do not apply due to their inapplicability or with the possibility
of their applicability, but the measures are not applied, as in the case
of sale by estimate.

Constructive  possession  includes  the  registration  of  a  mortgage  of
immovables and (hypothecation) of mobile movables like cars, trains,
steamers  and
airplanes  through  registration  that  is  valid  under  the
steamers  and  airplanes  through  registration  that  is  valid  under  the
law. Registration stands in place of actual possession with respect to
its rules and legal effects.
 3/5 The  possession  of  documents,  like  bills  of  lading  and  warehouse
receipts,  issued  in  the  name  of  the  possessor  or  acknowledging
his  interest  therein  is  deemed
  possession  of  what  the
constructive  possession  of  what  the
his  interest  therein  is  deemed  constructive
documents  represent  if  the  ascertainment  of  commodities,  goods
and appliances is attained through them along with the ability of the
possessor to undertake transactions in them.
 3/6 Prior possession of a tangible thing stands in place of subsequent lawful
possession due to a cause acknowledged by the Shariah irrespective of
the possession of the prior possessor being on the basis of the liability
to  bear  loss  (Daman)  or  one  of  trust  (Amanah)  and  irrespective  of
  possession  entailing  liability  for  loss  or
constructive  possession  entailing  liability  for  loss  or

4. Expenses of Possession
 4/1 Expenses of possession in financial commutative contracts
 4/1/1 The expenses of delivering the sold commodity -for presenting
it if it is absent, for ascertaining it through one of the customary
units where that entails a claim for ascertainment like wages of
employing a cubic measure, weight, linear measure and counting-
is the responsibility of the seller. As for the expenses of delivering
the price, if any, it is the responsibility of the buyer, unless there is
a stipulation or customary practice to the contrary, in which case
it is binding to follow such stipulation or practice.
4/1/2  The expenses of conveyancing, witnessing, preparation of instru-
ments  that  record  a  sale  and  the  formalities  of  registration  are
borne as stipulated by the parties to the contract. If there is no
such stipulation on their part, customary practice is relied upon.
4/1/3 Where it is stipulated by the buyer for the seller that the sold
commodity  be  delivered  at  a  particular  place,  other  than  the
one where it is present at the time of the contract, and that it
be delivered at the expense of the seller, the seller is bound to
deliver it at the specified place and the expenses of transporting
it to such place will be borne by the seller.
4/1/4 The  rules  for  the  expenses  of  possession  explained  in  items
4/1/1,  4/1/2  and  4/1/3  apply  to  all  financial  commutative
contracts,  like  Salam,  Istisnaa  and  others.  Accordingly,  the
expenses of delivering the Salam commodity will be borne by
the seller, the expenses of delivering the capital (Ras al-Mal)
will be borne by the Rab al-Salam
(the buyer); the expenses of
will be borne by the Rab al-Salam (the buyer); the expenses of
taking possession of the leased property will be borne by the
lessor, the expenses for the delivery of possession of the lease
value (wages) shall be borne by the lessee; and the expenses
for delivering the subject matter of Istisnaa will be borne by
the  manufacturer,  while  the  expenses  for  the  delivery  of  the
price shall be borne by the orderer. In all these cases, if there is
a customary practice or stipulation to the contrary, then, such
practice or stipulation shall be observed.

Shariah Standard No. (18): Possession (Qabd)
4/2  Expenses for delivery of possession in a loan (Qard)
4/2/1 The expenses for delivery and recovery in a contract for loan,
expenses that pertain to its ascertainment through one of the
customary units of measure and the like, shall be borne by the
borrower.
4/2/2 The  expenses  for  the  drawing  up  of  documents,  promissory
notes, title deeds and the like that are required for transacting
a loan contract; its implementation or documentation shall be
borne by the borrower. [see Shariah Standard No. (19) on Loan
(Qard), item 8]
4/3  Expenses for delivery of possession in a deposit (Wadiah)
  The expenses of deposit and withdrawal in a contract of deposit shall
be borne by the depositor (the owner of the deposit).
5. Key Modern Applications of Possession
5/1  Possession  by  the  beneficiary  of  a  bank  draft  or  personal  cheque
is  deemed  constructive  possession  of  the  amount  payable  by  the
drawee  bank.  This  is  deemed  possession  of  the  payable  amount
even  though  there  is  delay  in  the  payment  of  the  actual  amount,
keeping in view what is laid down in Shariah Standard No. (1) on
Trading in Currencies (item 2/6/5) as well as what is laid down in
the  Shariah  Standard  No.  (12)  on  Commercial  Papers  (items  6/1
and 6/2).
5/2  Payments for a credit card are deemed constructive possession of
such payments. [see Shariah Standard No. (2) on Debit Cards and
Credit Cards (item 4/4)]
5/3  A deposit by a person of an amount in a bank account maintained for
constructive
a debtor, upon his demand or with his consent, is deemed constructive
a debtor, upon his demand or with his consent, is deemed
possession  irrespective  of  the  deposit  being  by  way  of  cash,  by
endorsement or by cheque drawn upon a bank with which an account
is maintained, and the depositor is absolved of liability when he is
indebted to the extent of such amount.

a page of the register of mortgages is deemed delivery of possession un-

restriction, whether or not the moveable property needs to be delivered
through one of the customary units of measure, is that delivery of a thing
literally means delivering it completely without any impediments, so that
no one shares it with the possessor, and this is possible by relinquishment.
Further, the person who is under an obligation to deliver must have a way
through which he can be discharged of his obligation, and what is in his
ability is to relinquish it and remove all obstacles. As for actual physical
possession  (by  hand),  it  is  not  within  his  ability  to  provide  that  for  it  is
a  voluntary  act  of  taking  possession.  If  the  obligation  to  make  such  a
delivery  is  imposed  on  him,  it  would  become  difficult  for  him  to  meet

 Further, the
basis  for  stipulating  cubic  measure  for  the  soundness  of  possession  in
food that is estimated by cubic measure in the tradition from the Prophet
(peace be upon him) is the custom that was prevalent during the period
of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the effect that possession in things

analogy is to be employed. As the determination of the issue of possession
in  contracts  is  based  on  custom,  therefore,  everything  that  is  taken  by
custom to be possession in a certain period is to be deemed as possession
from the perspective of the Shariah. If the custom of the people changes
in  this  respect,  the  consideration  of  that  mode  as  possession  ceases.
The  reason  is  that  where  the  constructive  basis  of  rules  is  custom,  the

our times is based upon the consideration of the delivery of documents

estimation- as amounting to possession of these commodities and goods,
it  will  be deemed  valid  from  the  perspective  of  the  Shariah.  The  basic

   The basis for considering prior possession of a certain thing as a substitute
The basis for considering prior possession of a certain thing as a substitute
for subsequent possession on grounds that are acknowledged by the Shariah,
when it represents it, is that the purpose behind the realisation of possession
is to establish control over, and the ability to undertake transactions in, the
thing possessed. If this state is found possession is found too. This is based on
what is upheld by the Malikis and Hanbalis to the effect that if a person sells
a thing, or gives it away as gift or pledges it, while the thing is in the possession of
a  usurper,  borrower,  bailee,  hirer,  agent  or  another,  then  prior  possession
represents absolutely subsequent entitled possession through the contract,
irrespective of the nature of possession exercised by the possessor being that
of liability or trust and irrespective of the entitled possession being in the
nature of trust or liability. As for what arises from this with respect to the
possessor being liable for the thing possessed or holding it as a trustee, it has
(17)
no connection with or effect upon the reality of possession.(17)
no connection with or effect upon the reality of possession.
Expenses of Possession
The basis for the view that the expenses of possession of the sold commo-
  The basis for the view that the expenses of possession of the sold commo-
dity are borne by the seller is that the delivery of the sold commodity is
obligatory on the seller by virtue of the contract, and the contract is not
completed without it; and a thing without which an obligation cannot be
fulfilled is also obligatory. Accordingly, this is what was upheld by the ma-
jority of the Jurists to the effect that meeting the expenses of the delivery of
the sold commodity -by presenting it if it is absent and by ascertaining it if
it needs to be ascertained by a customary unit of measure- is the responsi-
bility of the seller. The basis for the view that expenses, if any, of taking
delivery of the price are the responsibility of the buyer, is that payment of
the price to the seller is obligatory upon the buyer, thus, it is binding on
him to bear the burden of all that is required by such delivery. The basis for
qualifying this rule to impose the expenses on both parties insofar as there

The basis for the buyer bearing the expenses of constructive possession
  The basis for the buyer bearing the expenses of constructive possession
of  what  he  has  purchased,  as  represented  by  official  registration  and
attestation for the sale of immoveable property or its mortgage in countries
that  have  adopted  a  system  of  registration  of  transfer  of  immoveable
property,  as  well  as  the  sale  of  some  mobile  moveable  property  like
cars, vehicles, steamers and airplanes or their pledging (hypothecation)
in  countries  that  have  adopted  a  system  of  officially  registering  such
things,  and  as  well  as  the  purchase  of  shares  of  corporations  -whose
trading is permissible according to the Shariah in markets for financial
paper-  is  the  customary  practice  in  all  these  things.  Further,  such
a practice secures the interest of the buyer and is supported by the rule
that  gain  is  linked  to  the  bearing  of  expenses.  It  is  also  supported  by
derivation of the rule from what has been stated by the Hanafi Jurists
to the effect that the expenses of the drafting of documents, promissory
notes and of witnessing, which confirm the transaction of sale, are to be
borne by the buyer as long as there is no custom or stipulation to the
contrary.

The basis for the seller bearing the expenses for the delivery of the sold
commodity  to  the  buyer  with  the  stipulation  of  a  known  place  (other
than the place of contract where it is present) is what has been stated by

doing good is not to be made to bear costs over and above his granting of
a thing, because No ground (of complaint) can there be against those who

Al-Aqar (Immoveable Property)
It is something that has a permanently affixed foundation and it is not
possible to transfer it or move it, along with the subsistence of its shape and
form, like land and houses.
Al-Manqul (Moveable Property)
It  is  something  that  can  be  transferred  and  moved.  Thus,  it  includes
cash, loans, animals, cars, ships, airplanes, trains, things subjected to cubic

It is the sale of something whose precise quantity is not known, and its
quantity is known through estimation without employing a cubic measure,

Al-Qabd Bi-Sifat Al-Daman (Possession Creating a Liability for Return)
It is the acquisition of a thing that leads to the liability for the return of the
thing, if it is a fungible commodity, that is, its return to its owner as long as
the thing exists, and its value, if it is non-fungible, on its loss or conversion,
whatever the cause of this, and this when it occurs without the permission
of the owner (as a wrongful act, delict, tort), like the possession by a thief or
usurper, or with the permission of the owner, but with the intention of owning
it, like the possession of one bargaining for it or one who has expressed the
intention to own it. Some Jurists have deemed the possession by the borrower,
the mortgagee (pledge), lessor and the independent contractor to be of this
nature.
 Al-Qabd Bi-Sifat Al-Amanah (Possession Creating a Trust)
It is the acquisition of a thing that leads to its treatment as a trust in the
possession of the possessor insofar as he does not bear the liability of its

keeping.  This  occurs  with  the  permission  of  the  owner  when  there  is  no
intention to own it rather it is for the interest of the owner, like the bailee,
agent, dedicated servant, Wali and Wasi, or it is for the interest of the person
acquiring it, like the tenant, borrower, and mortgagee, or for their common
interest, like the Mudarib, partner, tenant and irrigator.
Urf (Custom)
It is what is practised by the people and what they have come to follow
in terms of words, acts or relinquishment. The Urf that is acknowledged by
the Shariah is the one that meets the following conditions:
Urf goes against
1. That it should not contradict the Shariah. If the Urf goes against
1. That it should not contradict the Shariah. If the

that is void.
2. That the Urf should be continuous or predominantly so.
3. That  the  Urf  be  prevalent  at  the  time  of  the  undertaking  of  the
transaction.
4. That the two parties to the contract should not have expressly stip-
ulated against it. If they express such a stipulation the Urf is not
ulated  against  it.  If  they  express  such  a  stipulation  the  Urf  is  not
admissible.

IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MOST MERCIFUL
All praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, and blessings and peace be
upon our master, Muhammad, and his household and all his companions
Preface
This standard aims to elaborate the rules of the Shariah for loan (Qard).
Among these are the rules for a benefit (Manfaah) arising from a loan whether
or not this is stipulated (in the contract), just as it includes the regulations
of  the  Shariah  that  must  be  followed  by  Islamic  financial  institutions
(Institution/Institutions).(1)(1) Likewise, the Standard includes the Shariah rules
(Institution/Institutions).
 Likewise, the Standard includes the Shariah rules
for  some  applications  that  the  institutions  need  to  implement,  like  current
accounts, perquisites in return for loans, service charges for loans, and mutual
overdrafts between the institution and its correspondents.
 The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial

Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  Standard  covers  loans  and  the  accompanying  benefits  or  costs
irrespective of the institution being a lender or a borrower.
  The Standard does not cover what is not a loan (Qard), like the price in
a credit sale and investment accounts, because they have standards
specific
a credit sale and investment accounts, because they have standards specific
to them.
Definition of Qard
2. 2. Definition of Qard
  Qard is the transfer of ownership in fungible wealth to a person on whom
it is binding to return wealth similar to it.
3. Elements (Arkan) of a Loan (Qard) Contract and Its Conditions
3/1  The contract of loan (Qard) is concluded through offer and acceptance
by the use of the words Qard and Salaf or any other word or act that
conveys the meaning of Qard.
3/2  The legal capacity for making a donation is stipulated for the lender.
3/3  The  legal  capacity  to  undertake  transactions  is  stipulated  for  the
borrower.
3/4  It is stipulated for the subject-matter of the contract that it be known
fungible (Mithli) marketable wealth.
3/4/1 The borrower comes to own the subject-matter of Qard (the
wealth loaned) through possession, and he becomes liable for
(the repayment of) a similar subject-matter.
3/4/2 The applicable rule is the return of an amount similar to the
loan amount at the place where it was delivered.
Contract
4. Rules for Excess Benefit Stipulated in the Qard Contract
4. Rules for Excess Benefit Stipulated in the Qard
4/1  The  stipulation  of  an  excess  for  the  lender  in  loan  is  prohibited,
and it amounts to Riba, whether the excess is in terms of quality or
518518
Shariah Standard No. (19):  Loan (Qard)
quantity or whether the excess is a tangible thing or a benefit, and
whether the excess is stipulated at the time of the contract or while
determining the period of delay for satisfaction or during the period
of delay and, further, whether the stipulation is in writing or is part
of customary practice.
4/2  It is permissible to stipulate the satisfaction (repayment) of Qard at
a place other than that where the loan was made.
5. 5. Rules for Excess Benefit Not Stipulated in the Contract
Rules for Excess Benefit Not Stipulated in the Contract
5/1  It  is  not  permissible  to  the  borrower  to  offer  tangible  property  or
extend a benefit to the lender during the period of the Qard when this
is done for the sake of Qard, unless giving of such benefits is a practice
continuing among the parties from a time prior to the contract of Qard.
5/2  An excess over Qard is permissible in terms of quantity or quality, or
offering of tangible property or extending of a benefit, at the time of
satisfaction when it is not stipulated or is part of custom, irrespective
of the subject-matter of Qard being cash or kind.
6. Stipulation of a Period in Qard
It is permissible to stipulate a period in Qard. The borrower is, therefore,
under no obligation to return it prior to the termination of the period nor
can the lender demand it back prior to the end of the period. If, however,
no  period  is  stipulated,  it  is  binding  upon  the  borrower  to  return  its
substitute (Badal

It is not permissible to stipulate a contract of Bay (exchange, sale) or
Ijarah or other commutative contract within the contract of Qard.

Shariah Standard No. (19): Loan (Qard)
9. Service Charges for Qard
9/1  It is permissible to a lending institution to charge for services rendered
in  loans  equivalent  to  the  actual  amount  directly  spent  on  such
services. It is not permissible to the institution to charge an amount
in excess of such a service charge. All charges in excess of the actual
amount spent are prohibited, and it is necessary to ensure precision
in the determination of the actual charges so that they do not lead to
an excess that can be deemed a benefit. The fundamental rule is that
each loan bears its own specific charges, unless this becomes difficult
as in the case of a group or common loan, in which case there is no
restriction in the way of bearing direct collective charges for all the
loans on the basis of the entire sum. It is necessary that the method
of determining the charges be laid down by the Shariah Supervisory
Board of the institution in detail, and this is to be done by distributing
the expenses incurred among all the loans and each loan is to bear its
share proportionately. An explanation of such circumstances is to be
presented before the Board along with suitable documents.
9/2  Indirect expenses incurred in rendering services for loans are not
included  in  actual  expenses,  like  the  salaries  of  the  employees,
the rentals of space, assets and means of transport as well as other
management and general expenses of the institution.
10. Key Modern Applications of Qard
  Among the most important modern applications of Qard are the following:
10/1 Current accounts
10/1/1 The reality of current accounts is that these are loans and not
deposits. Thus, the institution comes to own the amounts
and a liability to repay the amount is established against it.
10/1/2 It is permissible for the institution to demand wages for ser-
vices rendered to the holders of the current accounts.
10/1/3 It is permissible for the institution to render services related to
deposits and withdrawals to the owners of the current accounts
with  or  without  compensation  like  chequebooks  and  ATM
cards and the like. There is no restriction on the institution
520520
Shariah Standard No. (19):  Loan (Qard)
if  it  distinguishes  between  owners  of  current  accounts  with
respect  to  what  relates  to  deposits  and  withdrawals,  like
exclusive booths for receiving the owners of some accounts,
or like distinguishing between the types or cheques.
10/2 Perquisites for Qard
It is not permitted to the institution to present to the owners of
current accounts, in lieu of such accounts, material gifts, financial
incentives, services or benefits that are not related to deposits and
withdrawals. Among these are exemptions from charges in whole
or in part, like exemption from credit card charges, deposit boxes,
transfer charges and letters of guarantee and credit.
  The  perquisites  and  incentives  that  are  not  specific  to  current
accounts are not governed by this rule.
10/3 Charges on credit cards for cash withdrawals from ATMs
10/3/1 The charges imposed on cards for cash withdrawals from bank
teller machines are a charge for services and are independent
of the loan.
10/3/2  It is necessary that the charges imposed on credit cards for
cash  withdrawals  from  bank  teller  machines  be  an  amount
that  is  certain  within  the  limits  of  reasonable  charges

Charge Cards]
10/4 Overdrafts between the institution and its correspondents
In  order  to  avoid  interest  between  the  institution  and  its  cor-
respondents,  there  is  no  restriction  if  the  institution  comes  to

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
The basis for stipulating that wealth given as Qard be known is to enable
  The basis for stipulating that wealth given as Qard be known is to enable
the borrower to return a similar substitute of the wealth of Qard.
  The basis for the rule that the borrower does not come to own the wealth
The basis for the rule that the borrower does not come to own the wealth
lent except through possession is that the contract of Qard is one in which
commutative aspect and that of donation stand combined, however, the
act of donation is predominant. It is for this reason that the rule is similar
to that for gift (Hibah) in which ownership is transferred with the taking
of possession.
The basis for the rule that the subject-matter of Qard be a fungible item is
  The basis for the rule that the subject-matter of Qard be a fungible item is
that it is only such an item that can be returned by the borrower. Further,
fungible  items  are  compensated  through  similar  substitutes  in  usurpa-
tion and destruction.
  The basis for the obligation of returning the counter-value of Qard at the
The basis for the obligation of returning the counter-value of Qard at the
same place where it was granted, when there is no contrary stipulation, is
that this is the governing rule.
Stipulation of an Excess in the Counter-Value of Qard
  The basis for the prohibition of stipulating an excess in the counter-value of
The basis for the prohibition of stipulating an excess in the counter-value of
Qard for the lender are evidences from the Qur`an, the Sunnah, consensus
of Fuqaha (Ijma) as well as rational arguments that convey the prohibition
of Riba (usury) in Qard.
Stipulation of Repayment in a Land (Place) Other Than That of Qard
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  repayment  in  a  land  other  than  that
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  repayment  in  a  land  other  than  that
where Qard was granted so as to provide a facility to the borrower whether
or not the lender benefits from this, is as follows:

a land other than that where Qard was made. This is a view upheld by
the Malikis and the Hanbalis and it was preferred by Ibn Taymiyyah
and Ibn Al-Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah.
2.  The stipulation of repayment in a land other than that of the Qard
is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower without cau-
sing injury to either along with the existence of a need. The Shariah
does not lay down the prohibition of interests that bear no injury. In
fact it lays down their permissibility. It does prohibit those that are
injurious, but here the benefit is mutual and they are cooperating to
arrange this. It, therefore, belongs to the category of cooperation and
participation.
3.  The basic rule in transactions (Muamalat) is permissibility, and the
stipulation of repayment of a  loan in a land  other  than  that of  the
stipulation  of  repayment  of  a  loan  in  a  land  other  than  that  of  the
Qard  is  not  expressly  prohibited  by  the  texts,  nor  is  the  meaning
expressly  stated  in  the  texts  so  that  prohibition  could  be  extended
through analogy. Thus, the repayment falls under the rule of permis-
sibility.
Stipulation of a Period in Qard
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  stipulating  a  period  in  Qard,  for
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  stipulating  a  period  in  Qard,  for
Qard  can  be  delayed  by  stipulating  a  period,  are  evidences  about  the
permissibility of a period of delay, the obligation of abiding by conditions
and  contracts,  for  the  realisation  of  the  purposes  of  the  Qard,  and  for
repelling injury.
Stipulating a Contract of Sale within the Contract of Qard
The bases for the prohibition of stipulating a contract of sale within the
  The bases for the prohibition of stipulating a contract of sale within the
contract of Qard are the following:
1. The saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): A Salaf (loan) and

2.  The  underlying  reasoning  is  that  the  word  Salaf  in  the  words
A  Salaf  (loan)  and  sale  (in
of  the  Prophet  (peace  be  upon  him):  A  Salaf  (loan)  and  sale  (in

one  contract)  are  not  permitted
,  means  Qard.  The  Hadith  indi-di-
one  contract)  are  not  permitted,  means  Qard.  The  Hadith  in
cates  the  impermissibility  of  combining  a  Qard  and  a  sale  in
a single contract. The generality of its meaning includes the imper-
missibility of stipulating a contract of sale in a contract of Qard as
well  as  the  impermissibility  of  stipulating  a  Qard  contract  within
a contract of sale.
3.  The  stipulation  of  a  contract  of  sale  within  a  contract  of  Qard  is
a means towards obtaining an excess in Qard as he may oblige him
with  respect  to  the  price  for  the  sake  of  Qard,  and  in  this  way  the
Qard will be created with a stipulated excess, which is Riba. These are
means that, by agreement, are to be prevented and blocked.
4.  The stipulation of a contract of sale within a contract of Qard removes
the  contract  of  Qard  from  its  main  purpose,  which  is  to  provide
a facility. The reason is that Qard is not a commutative contract, it is
rather  a  contract  of  piety  and  virtue;  thus,  it  is  not  valid  if  compen-
sation is stipulated in it. If Qard is linked to a commutative contract,
it will receive a part in the compensation and this will take it out of
its required purpose. This will nullify it and nullify the commutative
contract linked to it as well.
  The basis for the prohibition of a stipulation by the lender that the borrower
The basis for the prohibition of a stipulation by the lender that the borrower
gives him a gift is that in reality this amounts to Qard with an excess that
is stipulated for the benefit of the lender and this excess is the gift. Thus, it
amounts to prohibited Riba and removes the contract from the category of

generates a benefit for the lender and the Jurists have unanimously agreed
that  any  contract  that  yields  a  benefit  stipulated  for  the  lender  is  imper-
missible. The benefit in this stipulation is that the lender will benefit from
a second loan from the borrower, and this benefit is not in lieu of anything
other than the very Qard that he gave him.
Stipulation  of  a  Reward  for  Raising  Loans  on  the  Basis  of  Credit-
Worthiness
The basis for permitting the stipulation of a reward for raising loans on
  The basis for permitting the stipulation of a reward for raising loans on
the basis of credit status is that this is a counter-value for a service rende-
red, and this is what is upheld by the Jurists that a reward may be acquired
for recommendations and lending of status.
Charges for Services Actually Rendered
   The basis for the permissibility of the lender charging only what is equivalent
The basis for the permissibility of the lender charging only what is equivalent
to the actual costs incurred is that these are in lieu of the costs alone. The
lender is doing a favour and the person doing a favour is not to be penalised.
The basis for the prohibition of charging in excess of this is that in such
a case it would amount to an excess in lieu of the Qard. Resolution No. 13
(1/3) was issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy (OIC) regarding
the recovery of actual costs.

Material Benefits Not Stipulated Prior to Repayment
  The basis for the prohibition of material benefits not stipulated prior to
The basis for the prohibition of material benefits not stipulated prior to
repayment, unless these benefits are not for the sake of Qard or in lieu
thereof, are the following:
1.  From  Anas  Ibn  Malik,  may  Allah  be  pleased  with  him,  who  said:
The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, `When one of
you grants a Qard and a gift is made to him by the borrower or he
offers him a free ride on his animal, he is not to accept this from him,
unless such a practice was prevalent among them prior to the Qard.(6)(6)
unless such a practice was prevalent among them prior to the Qard.
2.  Reports of precedents laid down by the Companions, may Allah be
pleased with them, which indicate the prohibition of accepting the
gift  of  the  borrower  and  other  types  of  benefits,  unless  there  is  an
evidence that this is not for the sake of the loan, and that the lender
responds with a similar gift or adjusts it as repayment of the debt.
Current Accounts
The  basis  for  the  determination  that  current  accounts  constitute  loans
  The  basis  for  the  determination  that  current  accounts  constitute  loans
(Qurud), are the following:
1. That the bank comes to own the deposits in the current accounts and has
the right to undertake transactions in the amounts and to seek growth in
them (through investment). Further, it is under an obligation to return
a similar amount on demand. This is the very meaning of Qard, which
employs it
is the giving of wealth to one who benefits from it -that is, employs it
is the giving of wealth to one who benefits from it -that is,
and consumes it in pursuit of his aims- and then returns its counter-
value. This differs from Wadiah (deposit) in the terminology of Fiqh,
which is wealth deposited with a person for safe-custody so that he does
not employ the wealth and returns this very wealth to the owner.

2.  It is binding on the bank to return a similar amount on demand for
the current deposit, and it guarantees such return even upon loss of
the wealth, whether or not it was negligent. This is the purpose of the
contract of Qard, as against Wadiah in Fiqh terminology insofar as
the Wadiah is a trust in the possession of the custodian, thus, if it is
destroyed due to his transgression or negligence, he is held liable for
it, but if it is destroyed without such transgression or negligence, he is
not liable. Resolution No. 86 (3/9) was issued by the International Is-
lamic Fiqh Academy (OIC) regarding the status of current accounts.
  The basis for the permissibility of the bank demanding service charges
The basis for the permissibility of the bank demanding service charges
-for maintaining current accounts- for the services rendered, is an excess
over the duty owed by it, because it is entitled to such charges in lieu of
the acts undertaken by it and services rendered to the client.
The basis for the permissibility of the owner of a current account utilising
  The basis for the permissibility of the owner of a current account utilising
a chequebook and ATM card without compensation are the following:
1.  The additional benefit arising out of this issue is common for both
parties -the lender and the borrower- as both benefit from it, thus,
both benefits are set off against each other. In fact, the benefit that
goes to the client through the issuance of a chequebook and an ATM
card is secondary and is not a primary benefit insofar as the bank has
set up this system for serving its own numerous aims and objectives,
thus, the benefit accruing to the bank from this system is a primary
benefit,  while  the  realisation  of  the  benefit  for  the  client  from  this
system  is  a  consequence  of  the  employment  of  this  system  by  the
bank for its aims and objectives.
2.  The benefit derived by the owner of a current account -the lender-
from  this  system  without  a  counter-value  is  not  a  benefit  separate
from the Qard. In fact, it is a means for the satisfaction of the loans
acquired by the bank insofar as these are ways for the repayment of
loans for every lender as when he demands them.
  The basis for the prohibition of presents and gifts, when the underlying
The basis for the prohibition of presents and gifts, when the underlying
cause is Qard, insofar as the bank gives these presents and gifts to one
who gives it a Qard, is that these are by way of gifts to the lender prior to

the satisfaction of the loan when these are due to the Qard.(7)(7)As for the
the satisfaction of the loan when these are due to the Qard.
As for the

there is no suspicion about them.

  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  overdrafts  between  institutions  and
their correspondents is general need and that the benefit derived from
this practice is not specific to the lender alone. In fact, the benefit is mu-
tual. Further, it does not fall under the category of Qard rather it is a step

Preface
This Standard aims to elaborate the foundations on which international
commodity sales, between parties from different countries, are based whether
the  contracts  have  been  concluded  for  spot  or  deferred  commodities  or
through derivatives (futures, options, indexes and swaps). The Standard also
explains what is permissible out of these according to the Shariah and what is
not, along with an explanation of the Shariah substitutes for them within the
Islamic financial institutions (Institution/Institutions).(1)(1)
Islamic financial institutions (Institution/Institutions).
(1) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
institutions including Islamic Banks.

Shariah Standard No. (20): Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
   This Standard covers international sales contracts whose subject-matter
are  commodities  and  to  derivatives  of  various  kinds:  Swaps,  Indexes,
Futures and Options.
  The Standard does not cover financial and commercial paper or currencies,
because these have their own specific standards, just as it does not cover
sales that are concluded outside the organized markets.
2. Definition of International Sales and Their Kinds
2/1 Definition of international commodity sales
2/1/1 International commodity sales are contracts that are concluded
in  organized  commodity  markets  under  the  supervision  of
specialised  Organizations  and  through  intermediaries  who
coordinate  the  demand  for  sales  and  the  demand  for  pur-pur-
coordinate  the  demand  for  sales  and  the  demand  for
various
chases  by  employing  standard  contracts  that  contain  various
chases  by  employing  standard  contracts  that  contain
conditions and specifications along with a statement of the
period and place of delivery. The contract may also stipulate
the deposit of a portion of the price as a security for the ex-
ecution of the contract and opening of an account with the
intermediary.
2/2  Types of international commodity sales
International commodity sales are divided into three types:
2/2/1  Spot contracts
These are contracts that require immediate delivery and accep-
tance  of  delivery,  however,  delivery  and  possession  may  take
place within the limit of a day or two days in accordance with
the regulations of the market.
540540
Shariah Standard No. (20): Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets
2/2/2  Forward contracts
These are contracts in which both counter-values are deferred
with the legal effects of the contracts taking place at a deter-
mined future date, and delivery and possession take place at
that time.
2/2/3  Futures commodity contracts
These are contracts whose legal effects take place at a determined
future  date  either  through  liquidation  between  the  parties,  or
cash  settlement  or  through  counter-contracts,  but  they  rarely
end in actual delivery and possession.
2/3  Termination of international commodity sales
International commodity sales end in one of the following ways:
2/3/1  Contracts in which actual delivery takes place for both counter-
values or in one of them;
2/3/2  Contracts that end through the operation of liquidation between
the two parties;
2/3/3  Contracts that end in cash settlement by agreement; and
2/3/4  Contracts that end in counter-contracts.
3. Shariah Basis for International Commodity Sales
3/1  Spot contracts
  Conclusion of spot contracts in the commodity markets is permitted
with the following conditions:
That the commodity sold must be in existence and owned by
3/1/1  That the commodity sold must be in existence and owned by
3/1/1
the seller;
3/1/2  That the commodity sold must be ascertained in a manner that
distinguishes it from others;
The documents that establish the existence of the commodity,
its ownership and distinguish it from others are sufficient proof
of the realisation of the two previous conditions.
541541
Shariah Standard No. (20): Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets
3/1/3  That the contract should not include a condition that prevents
the  buyer  from  taking  delivery  of  the  commodity  sold  and
obliges him to accept a set-off for value;
3/1/4  That the price be paid on a spot basis. Delay, without the stip-
ulation of delay, in the delivery of an existing and ascertained
commodity, or delay in the acceptance of spot price, does not
affect the validity of the contract.
3/2  Forward contracts (both counter-values delayed)
3/2/1  These are the selling and buying of commodities with the stip-
ulation of delivery in the near future. They differ from futures
transactions insofar as they are not organized in an exchange
and  they  are  instruments  of  hedging  that  do  not  submit  to
financial supervision.
3/2/2  There are two forms for contracts with both counter-values
delayed:
3/2/2/1 That the commodity is a liability through description,
while the price is deferred, irrespective of the contract
being concluded with the word sale or with the word
Salam. These contracts are not permitted, because they
amount  to  a  Salam  contract  in  which  the  capital  of
Salam (Ras al-Mal) is not paid promptly. [see Shariah
Standard No. (10) on Salam and Parallel Salam]
3/2/2/2 That the commodity is ascertained, but a delay in its
delivery is stipulated along with a delay in the price.
Such contracts are not permitted.
3/2/3  When the contract is that of Istisnaa, such a contract is valid
even when the price is delayed. [see Shariah Standard No. (11)
on Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa, item 3/1/5]
3/2/4  There is no restriction in delaying one of the counter-values:
the  price,  while  observing  Accounting  Standard  No.  (20)  on
Deferred Sale; and the commodity sold, while observing Shariah
Standard No. (10) on Salam and Parallel Salam.

4. 4.  Key Applications of International Commodity Sales
 Key Applications of International Commodity Sales
4/1  Permissible applications of international commodity sales:
4/1/1  Appointing another person as an agent for the purchase of
a commodity at a spot price, and the sale of the commodity by
the agent to a third person for a deferred price on behalf of the
principal  along  with  the  determination  of  compensation  for
the agent as part amount or percentage of the purchase price
of the commodity. These are the operations of the Investment
Agency.
4/1/2  Appointing another person for the management of purchase
operations with a spot price and sale on a deferred basis with
the  manager  being  entitled  to  a  known  undivided  share  in
the  profit.  These  are  Mudarabah  operations.  [see  Shariah
Standard No. (13) on Mudarabah]
4/1/3  The agent undertaking -after the purchase of the commodity
on  account  of  the  principal-  to  buy  it  for  himself  from  the
principal  with  the  stipulation  of  distinguishing  between  the
liability of the agent and the liability of the principal for the
commodity and this by ensuring two independent offers and
acceptances between the principal and the agent. It is possible
that this be accomplished through the exchange of two advices,
one  for  notifying  ownership  by  means  of  agency  and  the
proposal of purchase (offer), and the other for agreement to
sell (acceptance). [see Shariah Standard No. (8) on Murabahah
(appendices A and B)]
4/1/4  Purchase by the institution of a commodity on a spot basis and the
subsequent sale of this commodity by the institution to another
on a deferred payment basis. In this application the avoidance of
543543
Shariah Standard No. (20): Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets
buy-back is stipulated, like the buyer selling what he purchased
with a deferred price to one from whom it was initially bought
on a spot basis at a price lesser than this (deferred price).
4/2  International commodity sales prohibited by the Shariah
4/2/1  Transactions in commodities that are not permissible.
4/2/2  Sale of the purchased commodity prior to its ascertainment in
a manner that distinguishes the commodity sold from other
commodities leading to the overlapping of the liability of the
buyer  and  the  liability  of  the  seller  due  to  the  mixing  up  of
what is owned by the buyer with what remains with the seller.
4/2/3  Purchase  by  the  agent  of  a  commodity  for  the  institutions
account and its sale thereafter to himself without the exchange
of  two  advices  of  offer  and  acceptance  between  the  agent-
buyer and the institution that owns the commodity so that the
liability of the principal (seller) and the liability of the agent
selling the commodity to himself come to overlap.
4/2/4  Sale by the agent of the purchased commodity before actually
or legally taking delivery. Legal delivery includes the transfer
of liability to the buyer (agent) by ascertaining the commodity
in a manner that distinguishes it from things other than the
commodity sold.
4/2/5  Commodity purchase operations of the institution through
agency and purchase thereafter by the agent for his own account
on a deferred basis by confining the transaction to an offer by
the  agent  to  the  institution  to  enter  into  the  transaction  and
acceptance by the institution thereof prior to taking possession
of the commodity by the institution or without the exchange of
the two advices of offer and acceptance.
4/2/6  Purchase  of  a  commodity  by  an  institution  on  the  basis  of  a
spot  price  and  thereafter  its  sale  to  the  (same)  institution  it-
self on a deferred basis, or its sale to a holding institution of of
self on a deferred basis, or its sale to a holding institution
the seller institution with complete or majority ownership, or
544544
Shariah Standard No. (20): Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets
with effective control, amounts to a buy-back (Inah) sale. [see
Shariah  Standard  No.  (8)  on  Murabahah  and  item  2/2/4  of
Shariah Standard No. (11) on Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa]
4/2/7  Sale  by  an  agent  of  a  commodity  for  his  client,  prior  to  the
transfer of ownership to him through purchase, to an institu-
tion that is his principal.
4/2/8  Sale  of  ascertained  specified  commodity,  without  its  passing
into the ownership of the seller, through fictitious documents
or the sale of the same commodity at the same time to more
than one institution dealing with the commodity. It is necessary
to be precise about the numbers of the title documents of the
commodity  along  with  the  fixing  of  liability  for  the  person
causing a discrepancy.
4/2/9  The lack of detail about compensation for agency (brokerage)
and merging it with the determined purchase price, which is
stated  as  an  amount  that  includes  it.  The  substitute  for  this
is the mentioning of the compensation and then deducting it
from the inclusive price, or the addition of the compensation to
the purchase price or the determination of the sale price with
the specification that what is in excess is the compensation of
the agent.
4/2/10 A statement within the general memorandum of agency for
purchase and sale of commodities that denies the right of the
buyer (principal) to take delivery of the commodity.
4/2/11 The institution making the payment of the purchase price of the
commodity contingent upon the agent providing a guarantee
for  the  payment  of  the  sale  price  by  the  agent  himself  or  by
another person.
4/2/12 Stipulation of a guarantee by the seller for the sale price under
all circumstances. He is obliged to provide a guarantee in case
like
of tort, negligence or breach of the provisions of agency like
of tort, negligence or breach of the provisions of agency
the stipulation that he obtain sureties from the buyers of the
545545
Shariah Standard No. (20): Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets
commodities with respect to the deferred period. [see Shariah
Standard No. (5) on Guarantees]
5. 5. Derivatives
Derivatives
  Derivatives have a large number of kinds, the most important of which
are: Futures, Options, Indexes and Swaps. The Shariah rule for derivatives
is based on the rule for the contracts employed within their framework,
as stated in paragraphs that follow:
5/1  Futures
5/1/1  A  contract  that  is  binding  under  law.  It  is  concluded  on  the
trading  floor  of  the  exchange  for  the  sale  and  purchase  of
commodities or financial instruments for a period linked to the
near future. The transaction is arranged with the mentioning
of the quantity, type and category along with the statement of
the date and place of delivery. As for the price, it is the sole
element that varies, and it is ascertained in the trading hall.
5/1/2  The Shariah rule for futures contracts
It is not permitted according to the Shariah to undertake futures
contracts either through their formation or trading. [see para. 4]
5/2  Options
5/2/1  A  contract  by  means  of  which  a  right  is  bestowed  -but  not
an  obligation-  for  the  purchase  or  sale  of  an  identified  item
(like  shares,  commodities,  currencies,  indexes  or  debts)  at
a  etermined  price  and  for  a  determined  period.  There  is  no
obligation  in  this  contract  except  on  the  person  selling  this
right.
 5/2/2 The Shariah rule for options
Options indicated above are not permitted neither with respect
to their formation nor trading.
5/2/3  Shariah substitutes for options
546546
Shariah Standard No. (20): Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets
5/2/3/1 The conclusion of a contract pertaining to ascertained
assets is permitted according to the Shariah, along with
the payment of part of the price as Arboun (Earnest
Money)  with  the  stipulation  that  the  buyer  has  the
right to revoke the contract within a specified period
in lieu of the entitlement of the seller to the amount
of earnest money in case the buyer exercises his right
of  revocation.  It  is  not  permitted  to  trade  the  right
established with respect to the earnest money.
 5/2/3/2  The conclusion of a contract for commodities in them-
selves along with the stipulation of an option for estab-
lishing  the  right  of  revocation  for  one  of  the  parties,
or for both, during a known period. This option is not
eligible for trading.
5/2/3/3  The issuance of a binding promise by the owner of assets
to  sell  them,  or  a  binding  promise  by  one  desiring  to
buy them, without specifying a counter-value for the
promise. This promise is not eligible for trading.
5/3  Swaps
5/3/1  Swaps are agreements between two parties for the temporary
exchange  of  determined  financial  assets,  material  assets  or
interest rates. In some cases the sale of a commodity or deferred
currency takes place without the transaction resulting in any
exchange of the commodity, while in other cases there may be
an option, in return for a counter-value, that gives the owner
the right to execute or not to execute the contract.
5/3/2  The Shariah rule for swaps
Swaps are not permitted in the forms in which they are practised
in commodity exchanges.

IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MOST MERCIFUL
All praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, and blessings and peace be
upon our master, Muhammad, and his household and all his companions
Preface
This Standard aims to elaborate the rules for the shares of corporations
just as it seeks to explain the rules for interest-bearing bonds.

Shariah Standard No. (21): Financial Paper (Shares and Bonds)
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers shares with respect to their issuance and flotation
including investment, trading, renting, loaning, pledging and Salam in
them, along with the rule for concluding futures, options and swapping
contracts on the basis of shares.
  The  Standard  also  covers  issuance  of  and  trading  in  interest-bearing
bonds. The Standard does not cover investment Sukuk for which there is
a separate specific standard.
2. Rules for Issuance of Shares
2/1  The  issuance  of  shares  is  permissible  if  the  objectives  for  which  the
corporation was established are permissible according to the Shariah,
thus,  the  objectives  of  its  formation  should  not  be  transactions  that
are  prohibited,  like  the  manufacturing  of  liquor,  trading  in  swine  or
transactions in Riba. If the objectives of the corporation are impermissible,
the formation of the corporation is permissible too, and consequentially
so is the issuance of shares that constitute such a corporation.
2/2  It is permissible to add a determined percentage to the value of the
share at the time of subscription to cover the expenses of issuance
as long as this percentage is fixed and determined to be a reasonable
amount. [see item 4/1/2/2 of Shariah Standard No. (12) on Sharikah
(Musharakah) and Modern Corporations]
2/3  It  is  permissible  to  issue  new  shares  for  increasing  the  capital  of
a corporation if such shares are issued at a price that is equivalent
to the value of the old shares, which is worked out through expert
valuation of the assets of the corporation or on the basis of the mar-
ket-value whether this is at a premium or at a discount with respect
to the price of the issue. [see item 4/1/2/3 of Shariah Standard No.
(12) on Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern Corporations]
560560
Shariah Standard No. (21): Financial Paper (Shares and Bonds)
2/4  It is permissible to underwrite the issue when this is done without
compensation in lieu of underwriting. This is an agreement, at the time
of the formation of the corporation, with someone who undertakes to
purchase the entire issue of shares, or a part thereof. It is an undertaking
from the person bound to subscribe at the nominal value to all that
remains and has not been subscribed to by another. It is permissible
to acquire compensation for work, like the preparation of feasibility
studies  or  the  marketing  of  shares,  irrespective  of  the  work  being
undertaken by the underwriter or someone if such compensation is
not in lieu of a guarantee. [see item 4/1/2/4 of Shariah Standard No.
(12) on Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern Corporations]
2/5  It  is  permissible  to  split  the  value  of  the  share  into  instalments  at
the  time  of  subscription  so  that  one  instalment  is  paid  and  the  re-
maining instalments are deferred. The subscriber will be considered
a participant to the extent of what he has paid up and will be bound
to pay his additional capital in the company, and this on the condition
that the instalments apply to all the shares and that the liability of cor-
poration remains restricted to the value of the shares subscribed to. [see
item 4/1/2/5 of Shariah Standard No. (12) on Sharikah (Musharakah)
and Modern Corporations]
2/6  It  is  not  permissible  to  issue  preference  shares  that  have  special
financial features leading to the granting of priority to these shares at
the time of liquidation or the distribution of profits. It is permitted to
grant certain shares features related to procedural or administration
matters,  in  addition  to  the  rights  attached  to  ordinary  shares,  like
voting  rights.  [see  item  4/1/2/14  of  Shariah  Standard  No.  (12)  on
Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern Corporations]
2/7 It is not permissible to issue Tamattu
2/7 It is not permissible to issue
 shares. These are shares that

grant the participant compensation in lieu of his shares, whose value
is redeemed during the existence of the company, and he is granted

based on capital, just as the owner of
a share in the assets of the company at the time of winding up until
the owners of shares based on capital have been granted the value
of their shares. [see item 4/1/2/15 of Shariah Standard No. (12) on
Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern Corporations]
2/8  The share certificate  or what stands in its place  is a document that
is deemed evidence of ownership of the shareholder for his undivided
share in the assets of the company. It is permitted that this document
be in the name of the owner, to his order, or for the bearer.
3. Rules for Dealing in Shares
3/1  A share represents an undivided share in the capital of a corporation,
just as it represents an undivided share in its assets and the rights
associated with it upon conversion of the capital into tangible things,
benefits, debts and so on. The subject-matter of the contract at the
time of trading of shares is this undivided share.(1)(1)
time of trading of shares is this undivided share.
3/2  It  is  permissible  to  buy  and  sell  shares  of  corporations,  on  a  spot
or deferred basis in which delay is permissible, if the activity of the
corporation  is  permissible  irrespective  of  its  being  an  investment
(that  is,  the  share  is  acquired  with  the  aim  of  profiting  from  it)
or  dealing  in  it  (that  is,  with  the  intention  of  benefiting  from  the
difference in prices).
3/3  Participation or trading in shares for purposes of conversion
  Participation or trading is permitted for purposes of conversion for one
for
who  has  the  ability  to  effect  conversion  by  adopting  a  resolution  for
who  has  the  ability  to  effect  conversion  by  adopting  a  resolution
(1) See the Shariah basis for the standard, item (18), for the permissibility of trading in
shares of corporations whose assets represent tangible things and profits along with
debts and cash that are in excess of the tangible assets and profits with the stipulation
that such tangible and cash assets should not be less than one-third. The reason is that
the debts and cash can be properly considered as secondary to them. (This explanatory
note  is  intended  to  complete  the  text  of  the  Standard  for  implementing  subsequent
amending procedures, God willing).

conversion in accordance with the Shariah at the first general meeting
or  by  striving  for  conversion  in  line  with  item  3/4/6.  [see  Shariah
Standard No. (6) on Conversion of a Conventional Bank into an Islamic
Bank]
3/4  Participation or trading (for investment and trading) in the shares
of corporations whose primary activity is permissible, but they make
deposits or borrow on the basis of interest
  The fundamental rule is that of prohibition of acquiring shares of and
transactions (investment and trading) in the shares of corporations
that sometimes undertake transactions in Riba and other prohibited
things  even  when  their  primary  activity  is  permissible,  but  from
this rule subscription and transactions (investment or trading) are
exempted with the following conditions:
3/4/1 That  the  corporation  does  not  state  in  its  memorandum  of
association that one of its objectives is to deal in interest, or in
prohibited goods or materials like pork (swine) and the like.
3/4/2 That the collective amount raised as loan on interest  whether
long-term  or  short-term  debt    does  not  exceed  30%  of  the
market capitalization of the corporation, knowingly that raising
loans on interest is prohibited whatsoever the amount is.
3/4/3 That  the  total  amount  of  interest-taking  deposits,  whether
short-, medium- or long-term, shall not exceed 30% of the
market  capitalization  of  total  equity,  knowingly  that  interest-
taking deposits are prohibited whatsoever the collective amount
is.is.
3/4/4 That  the  amount  of  income  generated  from  prohibit-
ed  component  does  not  exceed  5%  of  the  total  income  of
the  corporation  irrespective  of  the  income  being  generat-
ed  by  undertaking  a  prohibited  activity,  by  ownership  of
a prohibited asset or in some other way. If a source of income
is  not  properly  disclosed  then  more  effort  is  to  be  exerted
for identification thereof giving due care and caution in this
respect.
563563
Shariah Standard No. (21): Financial Paper (Shares and Bonds)
3/4/5 For the determination of these percentages, recourse is to be
had to the last budget or verified financial position.
3/4/6 It is obligatory to eliminate prohibited income specific to the
share that is mixed up with the earnings of the corporations,
and this in accordance with the following:
3/4/6/1 The elimination of prohibited income is obligatory on
one who is the owner of the share, whether an investor
or  a  trader,  at  the  end  of  the  financial  period,  even  if
the payment is due at the time of issuance of the final
financial  statements  whether  quarterly,  annual  or  for
other period. Accordingly, elimination is not obligatory
for  one  who  sells  the  shares  before  the  end  of  the
financial period.
3/4/6/2 The subject-matter of elimination is the prohibited in-
come specific to the share whether or not the profits
have been distributed and whether or not the corpora-
tion has declared a profit or suffered a loss.
3/4/6/3 Elimination is not obligatory for the intermediary, agent
or manager out of part of their commission or wages,
because this is their right in lieu of the work they have
undertaken.
3/4/6/4 The  figure,  whose  elimination  is  obligatory  on  the
person dealing in shares, is arrived at by dividing the
total  prohibited  income  of  the  corporation  whose
shares are traded by the number of shares of the cor-
poration,  thus,  the  figure  specific  to  each  share  is
obtained.  Thereafter  the  result  is  multiplied  by  the
number of shares owned by the dealer  individual,
institution, fund or another  and the result is what is
to be eliminated as an obligation.
3/4/6/5 It is not permissible to utilise the prohibited component
in any way whatsoever nor is any legal fiction to be
564564
Shariah Standard No. (21): Financial Paper (Shares and Bonds)
created to do so even if this is through the payment of
taxes.
3/4/6/6 The  responsibility  for  elimination  of  the  prohibited
component of the income, for the benefit of all, falls
upon the institution in case it is trading for itself or in
case it is managing the operations. In the case of inter-
mediation, however, it is bound to inform the person
dealing in them of the mechanism for the elimination
of the prohibited component so that he can undertake
it  himself.  The  institution  may  offer  these  services,
with or without a charge, for those dealers who desire
them.
3/4/7 The institution will apply the above rules whether it does so
directly or through another and whether it is trading for itself
or for another by way of intermediation or management of
wealth, like funds, or is doing so as the agent of another.
3/4/8 It is necessary to observe these rules throughout the period
of participation or trading. If the rules cannot be applied, it is
obligatory to give up such investment.
3/5  It is not permissible to purchase shares by raising interest-bearing
loans  through  a  broker  or  another  (margin  sales),  just  as  it  is  not
permitted to mortgage the shares for such a loan. [see item 4/1/2/6 of
Shariah Standard No. (12) on Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern
Corporations]
3/6  It is not permissible to sell shares that the seller does not own (short
sale), and the promise of a broker to lend these at the time of delivery
is of no consequence. [see item 4/1/2/7 of Shariah Standard No. (12)
on Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern Corporations]
3/7  It is permissible to the buyer of a share to undertake transactions in
it by way of sale to another and the like after the completion of the
formalities of the sale and the transfer of liability to him even though
the final settlement in his favour has not been made.
565565
Shariah Standard No. (21): Financial Paper (Shares and Bonds)
3/8  To secure lawful interests, it is permissible to specialised official agen-
cies to organize trading in some shares so that it cannot be undertaken
except through specialised brokers or those licensed to undertake the
activity. [see item 4/1/2/8 of Shariah Standard No. (12) on Sharikah
(Musharakah) and Modern Corporations]
3/9  It is not permissible to lend shares of corporations.
3/10 It is permissible to mortgage shares that are lawful according to the
Shariah, and in this respect there is no difference whether the assets
of the corporation are cash, tangible assets or debts or they are a com-
bination of cash, tangible assets and debts and irrespective of one type
being predominant in them. This is to be done in conformity with the
conditions for selling shares at the time of liquidation.
3/11 The contract of Salam is not permissible in shares.
3/12 It is not permissible to conclude futures contracts for shares. [see
item 5/1 of Shariah Standard No. (20) on the Sale of Commodities
in Organized Markets]
3/13 It is not permissible to conclude contracts of options for shares. [see
item 5/2 of Shariah Standard No. (20) on the Sale of Commodities in
Organized Markets]
3/14 It is not permitted to conclude swap contracts with respect to shares
and their returns.
3/15 It is not permissible to rent shares, whether this is for pledging them
or for the purpose of selling the rented shares, and returning shares
similar to them, as is done in the stock-markets, or for acquiring
their profits or for showing a stronger financial position of the hirer
or for another reason.
3/16 It is permitted to lend shares by way of Iarah for the purpose of
pledging  them  or  for  the  purpose  of  granting  their  profit  to  the
borrower as is done in stock markets. The borrower does not have
the right to sell the shares except for the execution of the terms of
the mortgage.

3/17 It is not permissible to undertake trading in the shares of a corpora-
tion, when the assets of the corporation are cash exclusively, whether
this is during the period of subscription or after that, prior to the
commencement  of  the  business  of  the  company  or  at  the  time  of
liquidation, except at their nominal value and with the condition of
delivery of possession.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Issuance of Shares
The basis for the permissibility of the issuance of shares, when the objec-
  The basis for the permissibility of the issuance of shares, when the objec-
tives for which the corporation has been established are permissible, is the
basis  for  the  permissibility  of  the  corporation  (Sharikat  al-Musahamah),
which is the generality of the evidences conveying the obligation of abiding
by contracts and conditions, the generality of the evidences conveying the
permissibility of partnership, and the generality of the evidences conveying
the  permissibility  of  Inan,  Mudarabah,  Musaqat  and  Muzaraah.  Inan  is
the basis for the permissibility of participation by two or more persons with
their  wealth  and  labour,  just  as  Mudarabah,  Musaqat  and  Muzaraah  are
the basis for the permissibility of participation with wealth from one side
and labour from the other side whether the subject-matter of the contract
is cash, as in the case of Mudarabah, or is tangible assets that are developed
with work on these assets, as in the case of Musaqat and Muzaraah. The
evidences for all these forms are well known.
The  basis  for  the  permissibility of  underwriting  the  issue  without  com-
com-
pensation  is  that  it  is  an  undertaking  that  does  not  have  a  coun-
ter-value,  which  is  the  taking  of  compensation  for  it.  In  this  regard
a resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy has been issued.(2)(2)

  The basis for the permissibility of share being in a persons name, at his
The basis for the permissibility of share being in a persons name, at his
order, or for bearer is that the Lawgiver wishes to establish rights through
writing and other forms, but He has not determined a particular form
for this. If -in the case of corporations- this takes place through the is-
suance  of  shares  on  which  names  of  the  shareholders  are  written  then
this  is  valid.  Likewise,  if  this  is  undertaken  by  recording  the  names  of
the shareholders in special registers, or indexes, or in any other way, or
even if the names are not recorded at all -neither on the certificates nor
elsewhere- then this is permissible.

The basis for the permissibility of the sale and purchase of shares of cor-
porations, when the activity of the corporation is permissible, is that the
shares are owned by the shareholder, and he has the right to undertake
transactions  in  them  as  he  desires  whether  this  is  by  way  of  sale,  gift
or another way, especially when each one of the shareholders has been

   The basis of the impermissibility of buying shares by raising interest-bearing
loans  from  the  broker  or  someone  else,  is  the  indulgence  in  interest  and

  The basis for the impermissibility of the sale of shares that the seller does
The basis for the impermissibility of the sale of shares that the seller does
not own is that this leads to the sale of something that is not within the
liability of the seller nor in his ownership, and this is prohibited accor-
ding to the Shariah.

The basis for the impermissibility of lending the shares of corporations is
that the share at the time of repayment-in consideration of what it repre-
sents-does not represent the same thing that it did at the time of lending
due to the constant change in the assets of the corporation.
  The basis for the permissibility of mortgaging the shares of corporations
The basis for the permissibility of mortgaging the shares of corporations
is  the  established  principle  that  a  thing  can  be  mortgaged  if  its  sale  is
permissible. As the sale of shares is permitted, mortgaging them is also
permitted. The reason is that the purpose of a mortgage is the securing
of a loan and recovering it through the sale price of the asset mortgaged
in case recovery is not possible from the debtor. This is what is achieved
through the mortgaging of shares and is, therefore, permitted.

  The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  Salam  in  shares  is  that  the  sub-
The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  Salam  in  shares  is  that  the  sub-
ject-matter  of  Salam  is  a  debt  and  not  an  ascertained  thing,  while  in
shares of corporations nothing works except ascertainment. This is done
by  mentioning  the  name  of  the  corporation  whose  shares  are  desired
through  Salam  thereby  rendering  the  shares  an  ascertained  thing  and
not a liability for a debt. Shares cannot, therefore, essentially be the sub-
ject-matter of the contract of Salam. Further, Salam in shares implies the
sale of ascertained things that are not owned and this is not permitted. In
addition to this, the constant availability of specified shares in the market
and the ability of the buyer to deliver them at the end of the period is
something that cannot be guaranteed.
The impermissibility of concluding futures contracts for shares is that
  The impermissibility of concluding futures contracts for shares is that
these contracts imply the stipulation of delay in the delivery of an as-
certained sold commodity, that is, shares, and this prohibited and not
permitted. Likewise, the delay in the price and the priced commodity,
for this is the sale of a debt for a debt, which is prohibited by agreement.
Further, the seller -mostly- does not own the shares for which the futures
contract has been concluded and is, therefore, selling something that is
owned by another. This is something over which there is no disagree-
ment  among  the  scholars  as  to  its  impermissibility.  It  is  also  included
primarily in the meaning of the Shariah Texts established By Prophet
Muhammad  (peace  be  upon  him)  that  convey  the  prohibition  of  the
sale of something that one does not possess. Again, most of the futures
contracts are completed through a cash settlement between the parties,
and this is brazen gambling if this is stipulated within the contract. If it
is not stipulated in the contract, it is still one type of gambling. Thereaf-
ter, the purpose of contracts is the delivery of possession, while in fu-
tures contracts delivery of possession is not
the primary purpose of the
tures contracts delivery of possession is not the primary purpose of the
contracting parties. These contracts, thus, create an obligation for, and
engage the liability of, each party for a debt that is of no benefit, except
by way of Mukhatarah and for waiting for a loss that will inevitably be
incurred by one party.

Shariah Standard No. (21): Financial Paper (Shares and Bonds)
contracts transacted in financial markets- is not included in rights that
can be sold. The reason is that this right is not established at all for the
seller as it is created through the contract and after its creation it is not
related  to  wealth  rather  it  is  related  to  an  abstract  thing,  that  is,  sale
and purchase. If established rights cannot be sold when these do not
relate to wealth, like the right of pre-emption, the right to custody of
children, the right of Qisas, then, rights -like the right of option- cannot
be permitted in the first instance. Added to this is the fact that dealing
in options contracts is based on Gharar, and Gharar is prohibited, just
like dealing in options contracts is based upon gambling and games of
chance, equally for the buyer and the seller of a right to an option, and
this occurs in cases that terminate in a cash settlement between the two
parties. The contract for an option falls under the sale by a person of
something that he does not own when he writes an option to buy, for
he does not own the shares or commodities that he undertakes to sell;
and the sale of what one does not own is prohibited according to the
Shariah.
The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  concluding  swap  contracts  for  the
  The  basis  for  the  impermissibility  of  concluding  swap  contracts  for  the
dividends of shares is that these contracts include Riba in both its forms if
the contracts involve the same currency, or
 alone if it invol-
Riba al-Nasi`h alone if it invol-
the contracts involve the same currency, or Riba al-Nasi`h
ves two different currencies; the sale of a debt for a debt as it is a contract
in which both counter-values are deferred; Gharar due to the uncertainty
about the amount of the cash at the time of the contract; gambling, as the
purpose of these contracts is the acquisition of the difference between the
two average returns on the shares and it is not the delivery of possession,
which is the purpose of contracts, thus, one of the parties gains and the
other inevitably loses, and this is truly gambling. Each one of these prohi-
bitions  alone  is  sufficient  to  prohibit  this  type  of  contracts,  then  what
about all of them collectively?
  The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares or corporations, which
The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares or corporations, which
include cash assets and debts, without regard for the rules of Sarf and dea-
ling in debts, even when such debts are more than one-half, is that in such
circumstances such assets are deemed secondary, and in secondary things
matters  that  are  not  normally  overlooked  otherwise  are  overlooked.  If,
however,  the  tangible  assets  and  benefits  are  less  than  a  third,  it  is  not

permitted to deal in the shares, except by observing the rules of SarfSarf or
transactions in debts, because in such a case the assets and benefits are
meagre and here debts and cash cannot be deemed secondary to them,
and they are the primary objective of the contract, thus, those conditions
are to be stipulated for them that would be applied to them if they were
desired separately.
  The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares of corporations whose
The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares of corporations whose
assets include debts and cash, when the objective and activity of the corpo-
ration is dealing in things and benefits, without regard for the percentage
of debts and cash, is as follows:

1. The Hadith of Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) stating:
When a person buys a slave, who has wealth, then the wealth is for the
seller, unless the buyer stipulates this too.(9)(9)The Hadith is explicit on
seller, unless the buyer stipulates this too.
The Hadith is explicit on
the permissibility of the sale without regard for the genus of the price.
The general meaning of the Arabic term

The general meaning of the Arabic term MalMal in the Hadith includes
all  his  wealth  whether  this  is  cash,  debts  or  goods  and  whether
this  is  less  or  more.  It  indicates  that  debts  or  cash,  less  or  more,  in
comparison with the price of the slave are not taken into account in
the Hukm, because they are in this case secondary and are not the
primary purpose of the contract.
Imam Malik relates this Hadith in Al-Muwatta` and then says: The
matter is settled unanimously in our view that if the buyer stipulates
the wealth of the slave then it belongs to him, whether this is cash or
debt or goods, known or unknown. This applies even if the wealth
owned by the slave is more than that with which he is purchased, and

The Hadith conveys
the permissibility of an absolute stipulation on the part of the buyer

As the fruit was secondary to the prima-
ry subject-matter, which was the palm-grove, it was overlooked when
it would not be if it was the only subject-matter of the contract.
3.  Among  the  established  principles  of  Fiqh  according  to  the  scholars
is  that  the  secondary  is  subservient.  One  who  examines  the  various
issues flowing from this principle, and the cases structured upon the
principle, will find that these principles as a group convey the meaning
that the secondary thing will take the rule of the primary and will not
be assigned a separate rule; it will come to be owned along with the
ownership of the primary, and something that will not be overlooked
separately will be overlooked when the thing is secondary.
Among the cases derived from the rules are the following:
a)  The  subservience  of  what  has  not  begun  to  ripen  to  what  has
begun to ripen even when what is ripening is very little. It is stated

The purpose of this Standard is to indicate the rules that govern Concession
Contracts  for  utilization  of  minerals,  water  and  the  likes  (Utilization
Concession),  or  construction  of  projects  (Construction  Concession),  or
management of government facilities and projects that provide services to the
public (Management Concession). The Standard also highlights the Shariah

Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  Standard  covers  the  basic  Shariah  rulings  relating  to  Concession
Contracts for utilization, construction or management of projects, and
provides guidance to Institutions on application of such contracts. It does
not  cover  legal  or  consensual  concession  rights,  which  are  subsidiary
rights. This standard does not cover franchises as it should be dealt with
by a separate standard.
2. Definition of Concession
  Concession in this context refers to the act of an authorized party granting
another party the right of utilizing, constructing or managing a project
for agreed upon consideration.
3. Permissibility of Concession Contracts
3/1  The concession contracts described in this Standard are permissible,
as set out in the Shariah rulings, unless those contracts comprise
an element that does not conform to the rules and principles of Islamic
Shariah. Such contracts are considered to be among the devices that
facilitate realization of public interest or the interests pursued by the
two contracting parties.
3/2  There is no Shariah objection to taking on the procedures required
to  the  offering  of  concession  rights  against  specific  fees  or  any
compensation stipulated in the contract, unless the deal constitutes
an  element  of  Riba  (usury),  Gharar  (uncertainty),  or  any  other
Shariah-banned practices.
4. Offering the Concession Right
  When offering concession rights, due consideration should be given to
justice, equality of chances, and realization of public interest.

Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
5. Concession Contracts for Utilization of Minerals, Water and the Like
(Utilization Concession):
5/1  Definition of utilization concession contracts
  A Utilization Concession contract is an agreement between the State
and a natural or legal person (Institution) according to which the latter
becomes the sole owner of the right of extracting and producing the
minerals,  water  or  any  other  object  in  question  against  a  specific
remuneration, as is shown in item 5/3 below.
5/2  Formal procedures of utilization concession
5/2/1 Granting a survey license
The  State  has  the  right  to  require  natural  or  legal  persons  to
obtain permission (license) before conducting survey in a certain
area against payment of a specific amount of fee or rent to the
State. Such a license does not grant its holder the right of the sole
surveyor in that area nor does it grant him the right to conduct
works relating to extraction through mining and construction of
the required facilities.
5/2/2 Granting exploration licenses
The State has the right to require natural or legal persons to
obtain permission (license) before conducting exploration in
a certain area for a certain period against payment of a specific
amount  of  fee  or  rent  to  the  State.  Such  exploration  license
may entitle its holder the right to become the sole explorer in
that area and the right of conducting the works required for
exploration.
5/2/3 Obtaining utilization concession
The exploration licensee, after discovering the minerals, water
or any object in question, becomes eligible for the exclusive right
of obtaining the utilization concession in the area specified in
the license, unless the license stipulates otherwise.
589589
Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
5/2/4 If  until  the  end  of  the  exploration  period,  the  holder  of  the
exploration  license  (the  licensee)  does  not  discover  the
minerals, water or for whatever the license has been obtained
then the licensee is not entitled to utilization concession at the
end of that period.
5/2/5 Notwithstanding the procedural order stated in preceding para-
para-
5/2/5 Notwithstanding the procedural order stated in preceding
graphs, the State may offer exploration or utilization conces-
directly, and without resorting to the above-mentioned
sions directly, and without resorting to the above-mentioned
sions
procedures.
5/2/6  When the State requests a specialized body to conduct survey or
exploration on its behalf, the contractual relationship becomes
subject to the rulings of Ijarah and Jualah. In this case Shariah
Standard No. (9) on Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, as
well as Shariah Standard No. (15) on Jualah, should be referred
to.to.
5/3  Shariah perspective on utilization concession contracts
  Utilization of minerals, water resources and the likes cannot take place
without  exploration,  which  entails  an  unknown  amount  of  effort.
Whereas  the  remuneration  to  which  the  holder  of  concession  is
entitled, is usually a well-defined lump sum amount or percentage
share of the output. The Shariah classifies such contracts as a form
of Jualah, where the State is the

5/4  Scope of utilization concession contracts
Since  utilization  concession  contracts  are  concluded  between  the
State on the one hand and natural or legal persons on the other, the
following should be observed:
5/4/1 When  adopting  the  Fiqh  viewpoint  that  considers  minerals
to  be  the  property  of  the  State,  whether  such  mineral  have
been extracted from a State-owned or a privately-owned land,
590590
Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
concession  contracts  may  be  applied  to  all  types  of  lands,
whether State- or privately-owned.
5/4/2 When  adopting  the  Fiqh  viewpoint  that  gives  the  right  of
utilization of minerals to the owner of the land or its usufruct
against a fee payable to the State, the following types of lands
should not become subject to concession contracts:
5/4/2/1 Privately-owned lands whether vacant or built on.
5/4/2/2 Wastelands that have been contracted for development
according to the relevant Shariah stipulations and legal
rulings.
5/4/2/3 Lands allotted by the State to natural or legal persons,
whether through change of ownership title or for tem-
porary utilization.
5/5  Requirements of obtaining the utilization concession
  A holder of a utilization concession is entitled to undertake all the
activities required for utilization, such as establishing refineries and
treatment laboratories, acquiring transportation devices and facilities,
etc. The holder becomes the sole owner of such rights throughout the
period of the concession license thereof.
5/6  Continuity of utilization
  Concession contracts usually indicate the commitment of the licensee
to continue utilization as per contract or the prevailing customary
practices. In case the licensee ceases utilization without a reasonable
excuse, the licensee may be given a reasonable grace period to restart
again  and  preserve  utilization,  otherwise  the  State  has  the  right  to
cancel the license thereof.
5/7  Product pricing and purchase by the State
5/7/1 The State has the right to determine in advance the way in
which the licensee should dispose of his share of the extracted
products and the value to be paid to him taking into account
public interest

In addition to its own share in the product, the State has also

the preemptory right of purchasing the quantities it needs from
the output, according to the prevailing prices and contractual
terms.
5/8  Expiry of utilization concession contracts
  A  utilization  concession  contract  expires  at  the  end  of  its  specified
period, or when the two parties agree to prematurely cancel it. The
contract can also be cancelled when there remains no more output to
be utilized. Moreover, each of the two parties has the right to revoke
the contract when the other party breaches a contractual condition or
commitment. In this case the breaching party has to compensate the
other party for any consequent actual damages.
6. Concession Contracts for Construction of Projects (Construction Con-
cession)
6/1  Definition and forms of a construction concession contract
6/1/1 Definition of a construction concession contract
A Construction concession contract is a contract between the
State and another party according to which the latter constructs
a specifically defined project usually related to public utilities.
6/1/2 Forms of construction concession contracts:
Construction  concession  contracts  may  take  several  forms
including the following:
6/1/2/1 When  the  licensee  constructs  the  project  according  to
certain specifications, on a piece of land owned by the
State,  and  the  State  becomes  the  owner  of  the  project,
while the licensee is entitled to the usufruct of the project
for a specific period. After this period, the ownership of
the usufruct is transferred to the State.
6/1/2/2 When  the  licensee  constructs  the  project  according
to certain specifications on a piece of land owned by
the  State,  and  the  project  and  its  usufructs  become
592592
Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
the property of the licensee for a specific period after
which the ownership of the project (and its usufruct)
goes to the State.
6/1/2/3 When the licensee constructs the project according to
certain specifications on a piece of land owned by the
State, and the project becomes a property of the State,
while  the  two  parties  agree  to  share  the  revenue  for
a specific period after which the project belongs to the
licensee.
6/1/3  In all three cases set out in 6/1/2, the licensee becomes entitled
to collection of fees or rent for provision of services to the public.
6/2  Shariah perspective on construction concession contracts:
  Construction concession contracts vary with regard to their Shariah
adaptation, according to the following conditions:
6/2/1 If the commitment of the licensee includes construction works
as  well  as  provision  of  materials,  which  is  the  predominant
case, the contract is that of Istisnaa. The value of the contract
is the right which enables the licensee to utilize the project for
ones own benefit for a specific period before handing it over
to the State.
6/2/2 If the project is constructed on a piece of land that the licensee
obtained  on  lease  from  the  State  against  handing  over  the
project thereto after a specific period, the contract is that of
Ijarah and the rent is the project itself which will be handed
over to the State at the end of the contractual period.
6/3  Remuneration for construction concession contracts
6/3/1 When  the  remuneration  for  construction  of  the  project  is
determined  in  terms  of  the  right  to  utilize  the  project  for
a specific period, the contract is considered as Istisnaa against
facility
a price determinable in terms of utilizing the constructed facility
a price determinable in terms of utilizing the constructed
for a specific period before handing it over to al-Mustasni.
593593
Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
6/3/2 If the remuneration for the construction of a project is deter-
mined  in  terms  of  a  certain  amount  of  money,  the  licensee
retains the ownership of the project to ascertain ones right to
get the price through utilization of the project. Licensee has
also the right of arranging a clearance deal with the licensor
so that the licensee can receive the full price and hand over
the project to the licensor before the end of the contract peri-
od. Otherwise, the licensee keeps on utilizing the project until
the receipt of the full amount agreed upon.
7. Application of Utilization Concession Contracts by Institutions
Institutions  can  apply  utilization  concession  contracts  either  through
direct  relationship  with  the  State,  or  by  playing  an  intermediary  role
in the contract between the State and the licensee. Application of such
contracts may take place in one of the following forms:
7/1  Jualah
It is possible to apply Jualah or Parallel Jualah
where the licensee re-
It is possible to apply Jualah or Parallel Jualah where the licensee re-
ceives a specific share of the output as remuneration.
7/2  Ijarah
Ijarah  contract  may  be  applied  where  the  State  gives  the  land  on
lease to the licensee for a rent payable as a predetermined share of
the
output. The licensee may, in turn, give the land on lease to a third
the output. The licensee may, in turn, give the land on lease to a third
party to establish the project thereon (sub-contracting).
7/3  Mudarabah
  Mudarabah may be applied where the State provides the land to the
licensee to utilize it on the basis of a predetermined rate of profit
sharing. The Institutions may either implement the project directly
or through two-steps Mudarabah.
7/4  Musharakah
In utilization concession contracts, Musharakah - whether fixed or
diminishing - may be applied as follows:
7/4/1 In fixed Musharakah, the Institution contributes a share in the
required capital besides the State or the party that executes the
594594
Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
concession license, and the Musharakah continues up to the
end of the contracts period.
7/4/2 In diminishing Musharakah, the Institution contributes a share
in the required capital, and undertakes (the Institution or the
party that executes the concession license) to sell its share in the
project gradually to the State.
8. Application of Construction Concession Contracts by Institutions
Institutions may apply construction concession contracts whether through
direct relationship with the State, or by entering as an intermediary party
in  the  contract  between  the  State  and  the  licensee.  Application  of  such
contracts may take place in one of the following forms:
8/1  Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
In this case, the licensee hires the land from the State with the aim
of constructing the project thereon and presenting the project back
to the State based on Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek. The licensee may,
use a sub-contract of operating or diminishing Ijarah, to rent out the
land to another party to construct the project thereon.
8/2  Istisnaa
Istisnaa  and  Parallel  Istisnaa  contracts  may  be  applied  where  the
State  is  al-Mustasni  and  the  Institution  becomes  al-Sani  (the
licensee is a parallel Mustasni) and the price of the product is the
income generated from the fee or rent collected from the public for
provision of the services.
8/3  Musharakah
In construction concession contracts Musharakah, whether fixed or
diminishing, may be applied as follows:
8/3/1 In fixed Musharakah, the Institution contributes a share in the
required capital besides the State or the party that executes the
concession license, and the Musharakah continues up to the
end of the contracts period.
595595
Shariah Standard No. (22): Concession Contracts
8/3/2 In diminishing Musharakah, the Institution contributes a share
in the required capital, and undertakes (the Institution or the
party that executes the concession license) to sell its share in
the project gradually to the State.
9. Disposing of the Concession License
  Since the concession license is a financial right, its owner may dispose
it of through selling, leasing, mortgaging, partnership or securitization
according to Shariah rulings, as well as the conditions imposed by the
licensor.
10. Management Concession Contracts
10/1 Definition of management concession contracts
  These are contracts between the State and other parties according to
which the right of managing public utilities and providing services
to the public is given against a specific price.
10/2 Shariah perspective on management concession contracts
10/2/1When the price for offering management concession is de-
termined as a lump sum amount of money or a percent
age of
termined as a lump sum amount of money or a percentage of
total income, the contract between the State and the licensee
is  that  of  Ijarah.  The  licensor  in  this  case  has  the  right  to
receive rent for offering the concession license, in addition
to the amount/percentage of income the licensor deserves
during the period of the contract. If the price of the manage-
ment concession is a percentage of the profit (net income af-
ter expenses and allocations), the contract between the State
and the licensee becomes Mudarabah wherein the capital is
the original facility or the project itself.
10/2/2 In both cases mentioned in item (10/2/1) above, the contract
between the State and the projects utilizer is either that of
 (sale) contract, as per the nature of the activity
Ijarah or BayBay (sale) contract, as per the nature of the activity
Ijarah or
in question.

be rescinded by t
he State when the licensee breaches a condition
be rescinded by the State when the licensee breaches a condition
or  fails  to  meet  ones  contractual  obligations.  The  licensee  may
also rescind the contract on condition that the licensee takes the
measures that ascertain the provision of the services to the public.
 10/4 Pricing of services
It  is  permissible  for  the  licensor  to  fix  or  adjust  the  price  of  the
services to be delivered by the licensee in a way that leads to establi-
shing justice and preservation of the interests of both the licensee
and the beneficiaries.
10/5 Observation of the contracts conditions
  The licensor has the right to perform (directly or through depu-
tation) monitoring and inspection to ascertain observation of the
conditions and specifications stipulated in the contract. It has also
the right to impose penalties stipulated in the contract, in case of
breach of contractual obligations on the part of the licensee.

Brief History of
 the Preparation of the Standard
The Shariah Board decided in its meeting No. (7) held on 913 Ramadan
1422 A.H., corresponding to 2428 November 2001 A.D., in Makkah Al
-Mukarramah to issue a Shariah Standard on Concession Contracts.
On  12  Jumada  I  1423  A.H.,  corresponding  to  22  July  2002  A.D.,  the
Shariah Standards Committee decided to commission a Shariah consultant
to prepare a draft standard on concession contracts.
In  its  meeting  No.  (5)  the  Shariah  Standards  Committee  (2)  held
on 1 Rajab 1423 A.H., corresponding to 8 September 2002 A.D., in the
Kingdom  of  Bahrain,  the  committee  discussed  the  Shariah  study  and
advised the consultant to introduce the necessary amendments, in light
of the discussions and observations of its members.
In the joint meeting of the Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2)
on 21 January 2004 A.D., held for discussing the observations made in the
public hearing that had been convened on the same day in the Kingdom
of  Bahrain,  the  committee  discussed  the  draft  standard  on  concession
contracts and introduced necessary changes. The committee also requested
the  consultant  to  review  the  document  in  light  of  the  discussion  and
comments of its members.
The committee once again discussed the draft standard in its meeting in
Dubai on 28 Rabi I, 1425 A.H., corresponding to 16 June 2004 A.D., and
made further changes therein.
The  revised  draft  of  the  standard  was  then  submitted  to  the  Shariah
Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (3)  held  in  Makkah  Al-Mukarramah  on  26-30
Shaban 1425 A.H., corresponding to 1014 October 2004 A.D. The Board
599599

made some changes on the document and decided to present it to some
experts for their comments before discussing it later in the public hearing.
A public hearing was held in the Kingdom of Bahrain on 15 Safar 1426
A.H.,  corresponding  to  25  March  2005  A.D.  and  attended  by  more  than
35 participants representing central banks, Institutions, accounting firms,
Shariah scholars academics and other concerned parties. Several comments
were  made  before  and  after  the  public  hearing.  Some  members  of  the
Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2) responded to the queries raised
during the session.
In the meeting of the Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2), held
in the Kingdom of Bahrain on 15-16 Safar 1426 A.H., corresponding to
25-26 March 2005 A.D., the comments made during the public hearing
were discussed and some appropriate changes were made.
The Shariah Board convened its meeting No. (14) on 2123 Rabi I, 1426
A.H., corresponding to 30 April  2 May 2005 A.D., in Dubai (U. A. E) and
adopted the Standard.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Concession for Utilization of Minerals
The right of the State to regulate survey or exploration of minerals, water
  The right of the State to regulate survey or exploration of minerals, water
and  the  like  by  offering  exclusive  rights  of  utilization,  stems  from  the
fact  that  such  an  act  by  the  State  leads  to  realization  of  public  interest
and prevention of disputes. This reasoning is adopted by the fuqhaa who
argue that development of wasteland requires State permission. The basic
assumption  here,  knowingly,  is  that  when  the  State  disposes  of  public
property,  its  act  is  supposed  to  be  that  of  serving  the  cause  of  public
interest, which should always surpass private interest.
  The  distinction  between  survey  on  the  one  hand,  and  exploration  and
The  distinction  between  survey  on  the  one  hand,  and  exploration  and
concession on the other, and the fact that only the latter two can enable
the licensee to have the exclusive status as a contractor, stems from the
fact that survey is based on mere expectation, while exploration is like

Tahjir  (retention)  in  wasteland  development,  which  usually  precedes

utilization. Thus, offering the exclusive right to the explorer can be based
on the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him):
Whom who develops
on the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Whom who develops
a piece of wasteland shall become its owner.(2)(2)
a piece of wasteland shall become its owner.
  The ruling that gives the one who discovers the minerals the priority

in utilizing them is extracted from the fact that exploration resembles
wasteland development, which entitles to ownership of the developed

The viewpoint of the majority of the Fuqaha, including the Maliki School,
that the minerals are the property of the landowner, focuses on their pers-
pective that deems land ownership as underground resources. Moreover,

  The  condition  that  the  licensee  should  sustain  the  activity  in  question
originates from the Shariah ruling on the case of a person who retains
a piece of wasteland for a period of time without developing it. In this
connection  it  has  been  narrated  that  Caliphate  Umar  Ibn  Al-Khattab
said: When somebody develops a piece of wasteland that had been left
for three years undeveloped by its original owner, the land becomes the
property of the developer(3)(3)

Permissibility  of  remunerating  the  licensee  by  allowing  him  to  benefit
  Permissibility  of  remunerating  the  licensee  by  allowing  him  to  benefit
from the project before handing it over to the licensor, relates to the fact
that in Istisnaa, temporary benefiting from the product may constitute
the price of its production. That is to say, the price can be either money
or usufruct including that of the product in question. This viewpoint has
been confirmed by a similar resolution of the Al Baraka Seminar.(6)(6) The

 The
other viewpoint referred to in this Standard is that the price should be
fixed first, and then the licensee is given the chance to utilize the project
until  he  gets  the  remuneration  agreed  upon,  regardless  of  any  specific
period of time. The basis for this viewpoint is that a predetermined period
may not be sufficient for getting the full price. This viewpoint, therefore,
seems to visualize the relationship between the State and the Institution
as a management relationship, as well as a clearance arrangement with
regard to the price to be paid and the period of utilization.

Permissibility  for  Institutions  to  enter  into  concession  contracts  with
the State directly or as intermediaries is clear because they do this in

Istisnaa and Ijarah. All these contractual forms are permissible whether
performed directly or though entering as an intermediary between the
State and the other original party to the contract.

Management Contracts
  Permissibility for the State to offer concession licenses for management
Permissibility for the State to offer concession licenses for management
of public utilities is justified by the fact that the State has the right of regu-
lating such facilities and collecting fees, and therefore it can transfer this
right to a second party. The management contract in this case is Ijarah
and the government has the right of identifying the lessee on the ground
of common interest.
   Permissibility of fixing the contracts value in terms of money is that the
 Permissibility of fixing the contracts value in terms of money is that the

a specific share of the projects income could embody uncertainty (Jahalah
pertaining to the possibility of realizing the agreed upon amount during
the contracts period. The relationship between the State and the licensee,
in this sense, is considered as an Ijarah deal. If such relationship is consi-
dered as Mudarabah, the basis for determination of the contracts value
will become a given share of the projects profit, which can be determined
only after preservation of the projects capital, which is the managed asset
in this case. The Hanbalis permit Mudarabah on income-generating as-
sets like animals. The reason behind the justification for sharing the net
profit after allocations is the preservation of the projects capital.

Permissibility  for  licensor  to  rescind  the  contract  when  the  other  party

Preface
The purpose of this Standard is to clarify the Shariah rulings that govern
the  activities  of  Islamic  financial  Institutions  (Institution/Institutions)(1)(1)  in
the  activities  of  Islamic  financial  Institutions  (Institution/Institutions)
  in
appointing agents or becoming agents of others, whether in arranging contracts
and  disposing  of  property,  or  undertaking  procedural  tasks,  or  managing/
investing  funds.  The  Standard  also  indicates  the  underlying  conditions  of
Agency,  elaborates  on  its  various  forms,  spells  out  its  repercussions,  and
outlines the responsibilities of both the Principal and the Agent. Moreover,
the  Standard  aims  to  embark  upon  the  Act  of  an  Uncommissioned  Agent
Fodooli and the Shariah rulings thereon.
 The  word  (Institution/Institutions)  is  used  here  to  refer,  in  short,  to  Islamic  financial

Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers agency and the acts of an uncommissioned agent in
This Standard covers agency and the acts of an uncommissioned agent in
concluding contracts on financial transactions (such as sale, Ijarah and
compensatory  reconciliation),  disposing  of  assets,  providing  services
and  conducting  practical  acts  such  as  receipt,  payment  and  delivery.
The  Standard  also  covers  areas  such  as  fund  management,  real  estate
and investment agency. However, it does not cover agency and the act of
an uncommissioned agent in several other affairs of life such as worshipping
(like  Zakah,  for  which  there  is  a  separate  standard),  personal  affairs,
penalty  affairs,  legal  prosecution/advocacy,  and  documentary  credits
(which have also been dealt with in a separate standard).
2. Agency
2/1  Definition, permissibility and characteristics of agency
2/1/1  Agency is the act of one party delegating the other to act on
its
behalf in what can be a subject matter of delegation and it is,
its behalf in what can be a subject matter of delegation and it is,
thus, permissible.
2/1/2 Agency is, basically, a non-binding contract for both the parties
thereto. However, it may sometimes become a binding contract.
[see 3/4 below]
2/2  Basic elements of agency
2/2/1  The  basic  elements  of  agency  include  the  form,  the  subject  matter
of agency, and the two parties to the contract (the principal and the
agent).
2/2/2  The form  of agency  comprises any act  that customary prac-
2/2/2  The form of agency comprises any act that customary prac-
tices traditionally consider a delegation of the right to acting
by someone on behalf the other. Such delegation comprises of
610610
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
offer and acceptance which has no standard form of wording
and  may  be  expressed  through  utterance  of  words,  writing,
messaging or gesture. In accepting non-paid agency, silence is
also considered as sufficient acceptance, while a negative re-
sponse is indicative of rejection of agency.
2/2/3 Agency may take place in any of the following forms:
2/2/3/1 Immediate  Agency,  as  usually  the  case,  where  the
contract becomes effective as soon as it is entered into.
2/2/3/2 Conditional Agency: where the validity of the contract
is  made  subject  to  fulfillment  of  a  certain  condition,
for instance when a debtor agrees to put his own assets
under the management of his creditor in case of default.
2/2/3/3 Future Agency: where the contract becomes valid only at
a specific date in the future.
2/2/3/4 Agency,  whether  free  or  limited,  shall  be  subject  to
specific conditions. In case of free agency, consideration
should  be  given  to  customary  practices,  interest  and
the state of the principal.
2/2/4 While  conditionality  and  limitation  may  be  resorted  to  in
concluding agency contracts, they may also be confined to the
disposal of the subject matter of agency. In this case, though
the agency contract is immediately effective, disposal is made
subject to the fulfillment of a specific condition, such as re-
sorting back to the principal before disposal. The conditions
set by the principal should be observed such as offering him
a guarantee or lien.
2/2/5 The subject matter of agency is for what the contract is entered
into. [see item 3/3]
2/2/6 The two parties to the contract are the principal and the agent.
[see items 3/1 and 3/2]

3. Conditions on the Agency Parties
3/1  Conditions on the principal
3/1/1 The principal should possess legal capacity to enter into con-
tract.
3/1/2 The principal should have the right to dispose of the asset in
question.  Agency,  therefore,  is  not  acceptable  from  a  legally
incapable person like a lunatic or an indiscriminating minor.
A  partially  capable  person,  such  as  a  discriminating  minor,
may appoint an agent for matters that result in absolute benefit
to him, such as accepting donations from others, but he cannot
appoint an gent in harmful matters like making donations. In
acts that may be harmful or useful, such as buying and selling,
a partially capable person may appoint an agent, but the acts
of  that  agent  remain  pending  the  approval  of  the  principals
guardian  or  whosoever  enjoys  the  similar  right  on  behalf  of
the principal.
3/2  Conditions on the agent
3/2/1 The agent should have full legal capacity, because a lunatic or
an indiscriminating minor cannot become an agent. A dis-
criminating  minor  may  become  an  agent,  provided  that  all
the  contractual  commitments  are  the  sole  responsibility  of
principal.
3/2/2 The  agent  should  be  aware  of  his  status  as  an  agent.  When
somebody acted on behalf of another and later on, the former
comes to know that he is an agent of the latter, the preceding
act  does  not  fall  under  the  agency  contract.  If,  however,  he
does so with the intention of performing the act regardless of
agency, the case should be subjected to the rules governing the
act of an uncommissioned agent (Fodooli
act of an uncommissioned agent (
). [see item 8]
Fodooli). [see item 8]
3/3  Conditions on the subject matter of agency
3/3/1 The subject matter of agency should be known to the agent.

dispute, or temporary uncertainty, may be dispensed with. It
can also be overlooked when, in absolute agency, the principal
authorizes  the  agent  to  channel  the  funds  in  any  form  of
investment. Nevertheless, the agent should observe the interest
of the principal, as well as the norms and customary practices
if necessary.
3/3/2 It  should  be  owned  by  the  principal,  or  he  has  the  right  of
deposing thereof.
3/3/3 It should be something that can be disposed of through agency.
This includes all types of financial contracts and dealings that
a person can perform personally. Any contract that a person
is  permitted  by  Shariah  to  be  involved  in  personally  can  be
performed through agency.
It should not involve a Shariah-banned practice, like trading in
impermissible commodities or committing usurious lending.
4. Types of Agency
4/1  Agency may take the following forms:
4/1/1 Specific  versus  general  agency.  General  agency  includes  all
methods  of  disposing  of  assets  provided  that  the  interest  of
the principal and the customary practices are well observed.
Disposal  of  assets  here  does  not  include  making  donations,
unless the principal authorizes the agent to do so.
4/1/2 Limited  versus  absolute  agency.  Absolute  agency  is  bound
by by  customary  practices  and  the  interest  of  the  principal.  It  is
customary  practices  and  the  interest  of  the  principal.  It  is
not permissible in absolute agency to sell at less or buy at more
than the market price, nor is it permissible to perform barter
and  deferred  payment  sales,  except  with  the  prior  consent  of
principal.
4/1/3 Paid versus non-paid agency. [see item 4/2]
4/1/4 Binding versus non-binding agency. [see item 4/3]
4/1/5 Temporary versus continuous agency. [see item 4/4]
613613
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
4/2  Paid agency
4/2/1 Paid agency is permissible in Shariah, whether remuneration is is
4/2/1 Paid agency is permissible in Shariah, whether remuneration
explicitly stipulated in the contract or ascertained in accordance
with the customary practices, as when the agent doses provide
such service except for remuneration.
4/2/2  When agency is paid, it falls under the Shariah rulings on Ijarah.
[see item 4/3]
4/2/3 The  amount  payable  as  remuneration  for  agency  should  be
known, whether in lump sum or as a share of a specific amount
of  income.  It  may  also  be  defined  in  terms  of  an  amount  of
income to be known in the future, as when remuneration is
linked to an indicator that may be quoted at the beginnings
of  different  intervals  of  time.  However,  it  is  not  permissible
to leave remuneration for agency undetermined and allow the
agent to take an unspecified share from the entitlements of the
principal.
4/2/4 When  remuneration  for  agency  is  not  specified,  it  may  be
measured in terms of the prevailing market rate for similar
effort.
4/2/5  Remuneration for agency may be any gain in excess of a specific
amount of output of the operation, or a share of the output.
4/2/6 A certain share of the output may be added to the specific re-
muneration of the agent, as a motivation.
4/2/7  When  the  agent,  for  no  reasonable  excuse,  refrains  from  car-
rying on agency that he has been paid for, and the work he has
done  was  beneficial,  he  becomes  entitled  to  the  remuneration
commensurate with the part of work done, and within the limits
of the contract value for that part of work. The agent in this case
is bound to indemnify the principal for any actual loss resulting
from his refusal to continue the work.
When the principal, for no reasonable excuse, forces the agent
to discontinue the work before the end of the agency period,
614614
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
the  agent  becomes  entitled  to  the  full  remuneration  agreed
upon.
When the principal, for a valid reason, forces the agent to dis-
continue  the  work  before  the  end  of  the  contract,  the  agent
becomes entitled to remuneration for that part of work he has
already performed.
4/2/8 Damage of the subject matter of agency does not relieve the
principal from paying remuneration to the agent for the part of
the work the latter has already performed. When the damage
occurs because of misconduct or negligence of the agent, he is
bound to indemnify the principal for it.
4/3  Binding agency
  Agency is, basically, not binding, because each of the two parties has
the right to revoke the contract without denying its effects that may
continue after revocation. However, agency becomes binding in the
following cases:
4/3/1 When it involves rights of others, as when the mortgagor ap-
points  the  mortgagee  as  an  agent,  or  when  the  mortgagor  is
authorized to seize the mortgaged asset or sell it on maturity.
Agency in the latter case is binding to the mortgagor (the debt-
or).  A  further  example  of  binding  agency  is  a  case  when  the
owner of an income-generating asset assigns the collection of
his entitlements to an agent manager.
4/3/2 When agency is a paid agency. [see item 4/2]
4/3/3 When the agent commences tasks that cannot be discontinued
or phased out without causing injury to him or to the princi-
pal. Agency in this case remains binding until it is possible to
suspend  the  work,  or  phase  it  out  without  causing  injury  to
any of the two parties.
4/3/4 When the principal or the agent undertakes not to revoke the
contract within a certain period.
615615
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
4/4  Temporary agency
4/4/1  Basically, agency has no time limit beyond which the contract
becomes no longer valid, because the agent can be terminated
at any time. The two parties, however, may agree on a certain
period after which the agency becomes invalid without a request
from any of them to revoke the contract.
4/4/2 The  effect  of  specification  of  a  time  limit  for  agency  is  con-
fined to restrain the agent from commencing new operations
subsequently.
4/4/3 Unless the contract stipulates otherwise, the agent may com-
mence new operations during the contract period even if the
effects of such operations will succeed the period of the con-
tract.
5. Commitments of the Principal and the Agent
5/1  Commitments of the principal
5/1/1  In contract of procurement agency, the price and other expenses
should be borne by the principal. Besides the price of purchased
commodity, the principal should reimburse the agent expenses
such as those of transportation, storage, taxation, maintenance
and  insurance.  In  paid  agency,  such  expenses  should  not  be
stated  in  the  contract  as  payable  by  the  agent  now  or  in  the
future.
5/1/2 In paid agency, the principal should pay the agent the amount
of remuneration agreed upon in the contract. [see item 4/2]
5/2  Commitments of the agent
  The agent is considered as a trustee in holding the asset in question,
and therefore, he is not bound to indemnify the principal for that
asset in case of damage. He shall be held responsible for indemnity
only when the damage results from his own misconduct, negligence
or breach of terms or stipulations of the contract. Breach of contract
for this purpose does not include acts that serve the interest of the
616616
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
principal, like selling at a higher or buying at a lower price. In this
regard,  Shariah  Standard  No.  (5)  on  Guarantees  indicates  under
item 2/2/2 the following:
It  is  not  permissible  to  combine  agency  and  personal  guarantees
in one contract at the same time (i.e. the same party acting in the
capacity of an agent on one hand and acting as a guarantor on the
other hand), because such a combination conflicts with the nature
of these contracts. In addition, a guarantee given by a party acting
as an agent in respect of an investment turns the transaction into an
interest-based loan, since the capital of the investment is guaranteed
in  addition  to  the  proceeds  of  the  investment,  (i.e.  as  though  the
investment agent had taken a loan and repaid it with an additional
sum which is tantamount to Riba). But if a guarantee is not stipulated
in the agency contract and the agent voluntarily provides a guarantee
to  his  principals  independently  of  the  agency  contract,  the  agent
becomes a guarantor in a different capacity from that of agent. In
this case, such an agent will remain liable as guarantor even if he is
discharged from acting as agent.
6. Stipulations on the Agent
6/1  Performing deals with ones self and relatives
6/1/1  When an agent conducts deals with his ascendant or descendant
relatives, who are neither under his guardianship, nor are the
agents  spouse,  the  deal  is  permissible  unless  it  encompasses
injustice or favoritism. In case of deals that involve relatives who
are under the guardianship of the agent, or deals that involve
the agents spouse, the agent should obtain the consent of the
principal.
6/1/2 An agent should not conduct deals with his own self or with
his son/daughter who is still under his guardianship, or with
) in the same contract.
Sharik) in the same contract.
his partner (Sharik
his partner (
6/1/3 The agent should not act for both parties to the contract.
6/1/4 An agent may purchase what he has bought for the principal,
by way of offer and acceptance. The deal should be concluded
617617
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
in such a way that the guarantees stemming from the agency
contract  and  the  sale  contract  are  kept  separate.  After  the
completion of the conclusion of the sale contract, the commodity
becomes  under  the  guarantee  of  the  purchaser/agent.  [see
Shariah Standard No. (8) on Murabahah  item 3/1/5]
6/2  Monitoring of the provisions and rights of the contract
  Monitoring the provisions of contract is the responsibility of principal,
whereas  monitoring  the  activities  stipulated  in  the  contract  (except
donations that should be assigned to the principal) is the responsibility
of  agent.  Nevertheless,  the  principal,  by  virtue  of  ownership,  may
pursue the agents activities.
6/3  Breach of contract stipulations
6/3/1 When the agent breaches the contract in a way that does not
serve the interest of the principal, the latter is free to maintain
the contract or declare it invalid. Breach of the contract on the
part of the agent may relate to the subject matter of agency or
part thereof, the price, on spot or deferred payment, possession
(purchase), or transfer of ownership (sale). [see items (8) and
5/2]5/2]
6/3/2 When the agent breaches the contract by purchasing at a price
that exceeds both the market price and the price set forth by the
principal, he should compensate the principal for the difference
between the purchase price and the market price. Similarly, if
the  breach  is  by  selling  at  less  than  the  price  specified  by  the
principal, compensation should be for the difference between
the selling price and the market price. Hence, the case here is
similar  to  what  happens  in  Mudarabah  or  investment  agency
whereby selling is stipulated to take place for a profit not less
than  a  specified  proportion.  And  hence,  the  agent  (or  the
Mudarib) doesnt guarantee that proportion, but his guarantee
is limited to any amount less than the price of a similar fungible
good.
618618
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
6/4  Appointing a sub-agent
The agent has no right to appoint a sub-agent except with the permis-
sion of the principal. Once a sub-agent is appointed, his termination
does not spontaneously follow the termination of the first agent, but
the principal can terminate him.
6/5  Appointing more than one agent
  When more than one agent are appointed in the same contract, none
of  them  should  become  the  sole  decision-maker  unless  with  the
authorization of principal. If they have been appointed by separate
contracts, each of them has the right to discharge their responsibilities
independently, unless the principal requires joint action from them.
7. Expiry of Agency
7/1  The agency contract expires in the following cases:
7/1/1  The contract expires when the principal or the agent dies or loses
legal capacity or when the Institution undergoes bankruptcy or
liquidation.
7/1/2 When the principal terminates the agent or the latter resigns.
In  case  of  termination,  the  principal  has  to  inform  the  agent
[see item 4/2/7], for compensation of loss resulting from refusal
by the agent to continue the work, or forced discontinuation of
work imposed by the principal before the expiration of contract
or agency term, in regard to the consequent remuneration or
damage compensation.
7/1/3 When the agent completes the work assigned to him in fixed-
task agency or the principal performs the task in question.
7/1/4 When the principal no longer owns the asset in question or the
principal  has  lost  the  right  of  disposing  thereof.  Agency  also
expires if the principal has performed the work, or the subject
matter of agency no longer exists.
7/1/5 At the occurrence of the incidence that has been stipulated for
ipso facto expiry of the agency.
619619
Shariah Standard No. (23): Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
7/1/6 At the expiry of the contract term in temporary agency. In this
case, the contract may be extended to the required term when
necessary. [see item 4/3]
7/2  Interminable  agency remains effective even after the  death  of the
7/2  Interminable  agency  remains  effective  even  after  the  death  of  the
principal or liquidation of the Institution. It continues up to the end
of the subject matter of agency.
8. Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)
8/1  An uncommissioned agent (Fodooli) is a person who discharges (in
the  absence  of  any  need  or  urgency)  the  affairs  of  others  without
being an agent or having a right to do so by virtue of Shariah. The
deal becomes subject to the rulings on the Fodooli, even when the
acts of a real owner makes him appear an agent.
8/2  The approval or denial of a contract concluded by an uncommissioned
agent  is  subject  to  the  discretion  of  the  owner.  Approval  of  such
contract by the owner should also precede revocation of the contract
by  either  of  the  two  parties;  otherwise,  a  new  contract  has  to  be
initiated. If the owner of the property does not approve the act of
the uncommissioned agent, the act becomes binding to the latter, if
he did not declare at the time of signing the contract that he had no
authority.
8/3  The rulings on the uncommissioned agent are applicable to all financial
contracts, including compensatory contracts like sale, purchase, rent
and hiring contracts, donations by way of gift, and investment agency
contracts.
8/4  When the owner of the asset approves the act of the uncommissioned
agent, the contract becomes effective, and subject to all rulings on
agency.  The  approval  shall  be  retroactively  effective,  based  on  the
date of such an act.

Permissibility of initiating agency in any wording which indicates initiation
   Permissibility of initiating agency in any wording which indicates initiation
thereof is based on the fiqh principle that What matters in contracts are
intentions and meanings rather than wording and constructions. Therefore,
whatever indicates delegation, which is the essence of agency, is acceptable
for  initiating  the  contract.  The  underlying  reason  for  consideration  of
silence as acceptance in case of non-paid agency is that acceptance in this
case is considered to have been given implicitly(6)(6). Effectiveness of the agency
case is considered to have been given implicitly
. Effectiveness of the agency
contract  can  be  linked  to  fulfillment  of  a  certain  condition  or  to  a  future
date because agency is delegation of power rather than an act of ownership

Imposition of four conditions on the subject matter of agency is necessary
to facilitate conclusion and validity of the contract that cannot be attained
without  these  four  conditions  namely:  existence  of  the  asset,  asset
ownership by the principal, possibility of disposing of the asset through
agency and the absence of any Shariah restriction that prevents the deal.
Permissibility of paid agency stems from the fact that agency is a useful
  Permissibility of paid agency stems from the fact that agency is a useful
work for which the agent has the right to ask remuneration. An agent who
is known to be providing agency services only against payment is entitled
to remuneration even when remuneration is not explicitly mentioned in
the contract, because a customary practice is acceptable as long as it does
not encounter a Shariah restriction. Non-paid agency is also permissible
because it is considered, in this case, as a form of donation.
  The justification for the clauses relating to remuneration of the agent is that
The justification for the clauses relating to remuneration of the agent is that
such clauses are essential to make remuneration well known at either the time
of the contract conclusion or in the future. Temporary uncertainty about
the exact amount of the remuneration is overlooked because knowledge
of the amount in the future will leave no room for dispute.(8)(8) Permissibility
of the amount in the future will leave no room for dispute.
 Permissibility
of adding a certain share of the profit to the principal remuneration rests
on the fact that such addition does not distort knowledge of the principal

amount. In this case, the commitment to offer the agent a certain share of
the profit is in the sense of a pledge to offer donation. Thus, the offered
share  of  the  profit  can  be  considered  as  a  conditional  gift,  or  as  Jualah.
There is another viewpoint that considers the pledged share of the profit as
a  subsidiary  addition  to  the  principal  remuneration,  and  concludes  that
in a subsidiary we can overlook what we cannot overlook in the principal.

Agency is, originally, non-binding because it is an act of delegation that
neither  the  principal  nor  the  agent  should  be  forced  to  continue.  The
exceptional  cases  of  binding  agency  have  been  dealt  with  to  preserve
whatever  rights  of  others  involved  therein.  Moreover,  an  exceptional
treatment is also needed for paid agency that should be subjected to the
rulings on Ijarah, as well as the case when there is a pledge not to revoke
the  contract  within  a  specific  period  because  breaching  such  commit-
ment may cause injury to others.

The agent is considered as a trustee in holding the asset because he works
for  the  interest  of  others  (the  principal)  and  trusteeship  is  the  normal
status in similar engagements. Moreover, the principals act of choosing
the agent for the purpose in question is an indication of his good faith
on him, and therefore the principal should not reverse that good faith,
except for misconduct, negligence or breach of the contracts limitations.
Impermissibility of combining agency and guarantee in the same contract,

is  based  on  their  opposing  implications,  in  addition  to  the  fact  that
guarantee by the agent entails a suspicion of Riba (usury). Therefore, the
status of the agent as a trustee contradicts with provision of guarantee.

   Impermissibility  for  the  agent  to  represent  both  parties  to  the  contract  
as  per  the  Hanafi  School  and  the  predominant  view  in  the  Shafii  School
  is  to  avoid  assigning  both  offer  and  acceptance  to  the  same  party,  and
hence prevent any probable self bias. Adopting the viewpoint of these two
Schools is, therefore, most suitable for Institutions to avoid malpractices and

the principal for loss, without committing the Shariah-banned practice

Shariah Standard No. (24): Syndicated Financing
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  syndicated  financing  operations,  whether  those
arranged among Institutions, or between them and conventional banks,
and the Institution-agent relationships relating to such operations.
2. Definition of Syndicated Financing
It refers to the participation of a group of institutions in a joint financing
operation  through  one  of  the  Shariah-compliant  modes  of  financing.
The accounts of the syndicated financing operation are kept independent
from the accounts of the participating Institutions.
3. Projects Financed Through Syndication
  Syndicated financing should be channeled towards investment activities
that are permissible in Shariah. It should not be totally or partially directed
towards projects that encounter Shariah restriction or constitute Riba.
4. Modes of Providing Syndicated Financing to Customers
  Syndicated financing should be provided to customers through Shariah-
compliant modes of financing, including the following:
4/1  Sale through bargaining, Murabahah or installments.
4/2  Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek.
4/3  Salam and Parallel Salam.
4/4  Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa.
4/5  Mudarabah.
4/6  Muzaraah, Musaqat and Mugharasah.
4/7  Investment Sukuk.
5. Participation of the Institutions with Conventional Banks in Syndicated
Financing
5/1  Originally, syndicated financing shall take place among Islamic finan-
cial Institutions.
634634
Shariah Standard No. (24): Syndicated Financing
5/2  There is no Shariah restriction against participation of conventional
banks  and  Islamic  financial  Institutions  in  syndicated  financing,  as
long as subscription and utilization of funds are arranged according
to Shariah-compliant forms.
5/3  Originally, the syndication should be led by an Islamic financial In-
stitution. However, there is no Shariah restriction against appointing
a conventional bank to lead the syndication and initiate, on its own or
with Islamic financial Institutions, the mechanisms and conditions of
operation management. Assigning the role of the Musharakah lead
manager to a conventional bank as indicated above is acceptable only
if the contracts, projects financed and the modes of financing are all
Shariah-compliant.
5/4  Arrangement, implementation and follow up of syndicated financing
operations  should  take  place  under  supervision  of  the  Shariah  su-
pervisory boards of the Institutions participating in the syndication.
Preferably,  a  joint  committee  of  the  Shariah  supervisory  boards  of
these Institutions could be formed and delegated to make decisions
that become binding to all parties.
5/5  It is not prohibited for Islamic financial Institutions to provide syn-
dicated financing to certain parts of a project that also receives fi-
nancing for its remaining parts from other sources through conven-
tional modes. This could be done on condition that the accounts and
lead manager arrangements of the two types of financing are kept
separate.  It  is  well  known  that  usurious  lending  and  borrowing  is
a Shariah-impermissible practice and the responsibility thereof falls
right on the party who commits it.
6. Shariah-Compliant Methods of Arranging the Relationship Between
the Syndication Parties
  The relationship between the Institutions participating in a syndicated
financing operation may be arranged in one of the following forms:
6/1 6/1  Mudarabah:
Mudarabah: The syndication manager acts as a Mudarib and becomes
 The syndication manager acts as a Mudarib and becomes
the exclusive operation manager according to the Mudarabah contract.
[see Shariah Standard No. (13) on Mudarabah, item 8/9]

6/2 6/2  Musharakah:
Musharakah:  The  institutions  participate  jointly  in  providing  the
  The  institutions  participate  jointly  in  providing  the
funds  and  bearing  any  losses  proportionately,  whereas  profits  are
shared as agreed upon. In this case, the Institutions may select a joint
committee to undertake management, or they may delegate one of
them to manage the company against an increase in its profit share or
a lump sum payment. A separate management contract in this case
should be signed with the selected Institution. [see Shariah Standard
No. (12) on Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern corporations]
6/3  Paid agency:
6/3
Paid agency: In this case, the work to be done should be clearly defined,
 In this case, the work to be done should be clearly defined,
along with estimation of the period of agency. The agent shall become
entitled to remuneration whether profit is actually materialized or not.
Furthermore, the agent may be given a bonus as a lump sum amount
or a share of profits above a certain limit. [See Shariah Standard No.
(23) on Agency and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)]
6/4 6/4  Non-paid agency:
Non-paid agency: The lead manager in this case undertakes to manage
 The lead manager in this case undertakes to manage
the operations for no reward, and the financing Institutions share the
profit.
7. Preparatory Tasks and Commissions
7/1  It is permissible for the leading Institution to receive commission for
performing the preparatory tasks such as conducting feasibility stud-
ies, organization, mobilization of participatory funds, preparations of
contracts etc. The commission thus obtained may be equal to, less or
more than the actual cost the Institution incurs for carrying out such
tasks. Furthermore, an Institution performing such tasks against the
commission may or may not be a lead manager.
7/2  Musharakah It is not permissible to receive commitment commission.
[see Shariah Standard No. (17) on Investment Sukuk and Shariah
Standard No. (8) on Mudarabah, item 2/4/1]
8. Provision of Guarantee and Suretyship by the Syndication Manager
8/1  In  dealing  with  the  syndication  funds  the  lead  manager  (being
a Mudarib, partner or an agent) is considered as a trustee, and there-
fore he should not guarantee these funds except in case of miscon-
636636

duct, negligence or breach of conditions embodied in syndication
arrangement.  [see  Shariah  Standard  No.  (5)  on  Guarantees,  item
2/2/2]
8/2  It is not permissible for the Institution that manages the syndica-
tion as a Mudarib, partner or an agent to guarantee the debtors of
his  partners,  or  to  guarantee  the  contributions  of  these  partners
against exchange rate fluctuations. [see Shariah Standard No. (5)
Agency and the
on Guarantees and Shariah Standard No. (23) on Agency and the
on Guarantees and Shariah Standard No. (23) on
Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)]
9. Exchange Rates
9/1  A specific currency should be fixed for the syndicated financing oper-
ation. However, the participating parties may pay their contributions
in other currencies on condition of revaluating the contributions in
terms of the syndication currency, and according to the prevailing ex-
change rate on the same day of contributions payment.
9/2  It is permissible for any of the participating Institutions to receive all
its profits and entitlements in a currency other than the currency of
the syndication on the condition of revaluing the receipts in terms of
syndication currency and , according to the prevailing exchange rate
on the day of receiving such amounts.
9/3  It is impermissible for the investment agent or any other party of the
Musharakah or the Mudarabah to provide a commitment to safeguard
any  other  party  against  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  [see  Shariah
Standard No. (1) on Trading in Currencies, item 2/9/3]
10. Exit in Syndicated Financing
10/1  It is permissible to agree on a closed syndicated financing operation
that does not allow premature exit.
10/2  It is permissible for an Institution to dispose of its share in the in-
vestment to an external or internal party before liquidation, as per
the contract conditions, and at the value agreed upon, if the physical
assets and usufructs of the company exceed its cash money, debts
and financial rights. If the companys cash money, debts and finan-
637637

cial rights are predominant, Shariah rulings on currency exchange
and debt-related transactions should be referred to and applied. It
is, however, not permissible to agree beforehand on such transfer of
shares at nominal value or on guarantee of a certain limit of profits.

The Shariah Board decided in its meeting No. (10) held on 2  7 Rabi
I,  1424  A.H.,  corresponding  to  38  May  2001  A.D.,  in  Al-Madinah  Al-
Munawwarah to issue a Shariah Standard on Syndicated Financing.
On 7 Dhul-Hajjah 1424 A.H., corresponding to 29 January 2004 A.D.,
the Shariah Standards Committee decided to appoint a Shariah consultant
to prepare a draft standard on Syndicated Financing.
In its meeting No. (11) held on 25-26 Safar 1425 A.H., corresponding to
15-16 April 2004 A.D., in the Kingdom Of Bahrain, the Shariah Standards
Committee (1) discussed the Shariah study and advised the consultant to
make necessary changes in the light of the discussions and observations of
its members.
In its meeting No. (12) held on 28 Rabi II, 1425 A.H., corresponding to
16 June 2004 A.D., in Dubai (U.A.E) the Shariah Standards Committee (1)
discussed  the  draft  Standard  on  Syndicated  Financing,  introduced  some
changes and asked the consultant to make further necessary changes in the
light of the discussions and observations of its members.
Once  again,  the  committee  discussed  the  draft  standard  in  its  meeting
held on 2425 Rajab 1425 A.H., corresponding to 910 September 2004 A.D.,
and made further changes in the light of the discussions and observations of
its members.
The  revised  draft  of  the  standard  was  then  submitted  to  the  Shariah
Board in its meeting No. (13) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 26-30
Shaban 1425 A.H., corresponding to 1014 October 2004 A.D. The Board

tivities that do not entail dealing in a Shariah-impermissible commodity
or service, is dictated by the need to abide by the directives outlined in the
Holy Qur`an verses and the noble Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon
him). These divine sources prohibit usury, alcoholic drinks, drugs, gam-
bling, pork, illegitimate carcasses, prostitution, nightclubs, statues, etc, as
well as impermissible acts like deception, bribe, cheating in weight and
measurement, and all types of prohibited sales, etc.(2)(2)

this case. The reason is that the Musharakah can avoid Shariah-banned
practices by explicit reference to the firm commitment of the conventional
Institution that leads the syndication to Shariah rulings in transactions,
besides tightening the control and supervision of the Shariah boards of the
participating Institutions throughout the various stages of the syndicated
financing operation.
Preparatory Tasks and Commissions

Permissibility  of  receiving  commissions  for  performing  preparatory
tasks, originates from the fact that such tasks are beneficial to the partners
and do not embark on any Shariah-impermissible practice. As regards
the justification for the ruling that the commission can be equal to, less
or more than the actual cost of providing the tasks, it is because the two
parties  are  free  to  make  what  is  known  as  a  permissible  condition,  or
resort  to  mutual  consent.  This  same  viewpoint  was  the  Fiqhi  opinion
of  the  Al  Baraka  Seminar  as  well  as  the  Fiqhi  Seminar  of  the  Kuwait

Provision of Guarantee and Suretyship by the Lead bank
  A lead bank should not provide guarantee except in case of misconduct and
A lead bank should not provide guarantee except in case of misconduct and
negligence. Being a partner in the operation, it is supposed to be holding
the  assets  as  a  trustee,  and  hence,  it  should  not  provide  any  guarantee.
Stating such guarantee in the contract constitutes a violation of the Shariah
rulings  on  trusteeship.  When  the  managing  bank  commits  misconduct
or negligence, or resort to fraud and trickery in the studies it prepares, it
should then indemnify the partners for the injury it has deliberately caused
to them.

A bank that manages the syndication through Mudarabah or Musharakah
should  not  provide  a  warranty  cover  against  default  of  the  debtors  of  its

rate fluctuations, because provision of guarantee by a partner or a Mudarib
to his other partners/owners of the capital is prohibited by Shariah.

When  the  bank  manages  the  syndication  as  an  agent,  it  may  provide
a warranty cover for the debtors of his partners in a separate contract and
without  referring  to  warranty  in  the  agency  contract.  The  justification
here is that the bank does not provide such warranty in its capacity as an
agent of the partners, and the warranty thus provided against default of
the debtors will remain valid even if the agency contract is revoked.

Permissibility for the parties of the syndication to make their contributions
in  currencies  other  than  that  of  the  syndication  on  condition  that  such
contributions be revaluated according to the prevailing exchange rates is
derived from a Hadith narrated by Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with
him). Ibn Umar said: When I told the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon
him) that I used to sell camels at Al-Baqi in dinars and receive the value in
dirhams, he (peace be upon him) said:

Shariah Standard No. (25): Combination of Contracts
Statement of the Standard
Scope of the Standard
1. 1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers transactions that comprise more than one contract
combined together in one set. The scope of the discussion in this respect
covers  the  definition,  forms,  controls,  characteristics,  and  concessions
relating  to  the  process  of  Combination  of  Contracts  and  explores  the
characteristics of Muwata`ah and the Shariah rulings pertaining thereto.
The discussion also embarks on contemporary applications of combined
contracts.
2. Concept of Combination of Contracts
2/1  Combination of contracts is a process that takes place between two
parties  or  more,  and  entails  the  simultaneous  conclusion  of  more
than one contract. Hence, combination of contracts may take any of
the following forms:
2/1/1 Combining more than one contract without imposing any of
them as a condition in the other, and without prior agreement
(Muwata`ah) to do so.
2/1/2 Combining more than one contract while imposing some of
them as conditions in the others, without prior agreement to
do so.
2/1/3 Combining more than one contract subject to prior agreement
(Muwata`ah), but without imposing any of them as a condition
in the others.
2/1/4 Agreement to conclude the deal through any of different con-
tractual forms as will be finally decided in the future.
2/2  Forms of combined contracts
2/2/1  Combined contracts may have a single lump sum counter value.

simultaneously rents his car to the same party for one month,
both against one thousand dinars.
2/2/2 Combined  contracts  may  be  concluded  for  separate  values.
For instance, one party may sell his house to the other for one
thousand  dinars,  and  rent  his  car  to  the  same  party  for  one
hundred dinars per month.
2/2/3  Some of the combined contracts may be stipulated as conditions
in the other contracts. One party, for instance, may say to the
other party that I will sell you my house for ten thousand dinars,
on condition that you undertake to rent the house to me for two
years  for  one  thousand  dinars  per  year.  The  sale  of  the  house
in this manner could also be concluded on condition that the
buyer  of  the  house  undertakes  in  return  to  sell  his  car  to  the
seller for two thousand dinars.
2/2/4 Combined contracts may take the form of an exhaustive con-
tractual statement comprising a number of successive parts
and
tractual statement comprising a number of successive parts and
stages, which finally lead to realization of the desire of the two
parties  to  conclude  the  deal  in  question.  A  good  example  in
this regard may be seen in a number of present day financial
transactions like Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, Murabahah, and
Diminishing Musharakah.
Shariah Status of Combination of Contracts
3. 3. Shariah Status of Combination of Contracts
It is permissible in Shariah to combine more than one contract in one set,
without imposing one contract as a condition in the other, and provided
that  each  contract  is  permissible  on  its  own.  Combining  contracts  in
this manner is acceptable unless it encounters a Shariah restriction that
entails its prohibition on exceptional basis.
4. Shariah Controls on Combination of Contracts
4/1  Contracts combining should not include the cases that are explicitly
banned by Shariah like combing sale and lending in one contract.
4/2  It should not be used as a trick for committing Riba such as agreement
between two parties to practice Bay al-Inah
between two parties to practice
Bay al-Inah or
Riba al-Fadl.
 or Riba al-Fadl
653653
Shariah Standard No. (25): Combination of Contracts
4/3  It  should  not  be  used  as  an  excuse  for  practicing  Riba.  The  two
parties could misuse, for instance, Contracts Combining when they
conclude a lending contract that, at the same time, facilitates some
other compensatory gains to them. For example, they could stipulate
in  the  contract  that  the  borrower  should  offer  accommodation  in
his  house  to  the  lender,  or  should  grant  him  a  present.  Contracts
Combining could also be misused by imposing excess repayment in
terms of quantity or quality on the borrower. [see Shariah Standard
No. (14) on Loan (Qard)  item 1/4]
4/4  Combined  contracts  should  not  reveal  disparity  or  contradiction
with regard to their underlying rulings and ultimate goals. Examples
of  contradictory  contracts  include  granting  an  asset  to  somebody
as a gift and selling/leasing it to him simultaneously, or combining
Mudarabah  with  lending  the  Mudarabah  capital  to  the  Mudarib,
or  currency  exchange  with  Jualah,  or  Salam  with  Jualah  for  the
same contract value, or leasing with selling (i.e. hire-purchase in its
traditional form).
Combination of Contracts
5. Shariah Concessions for Combination of Contracts
5. Shariah Concessions for
5/1  In principle, the Shariah concessions that can be granted to implicit
and subsidiary contracts at the time of combining contracts cannot
be granted to the same contracts when concluded independently. Here,
implicit and subsidiary contracts refer to contractual commitments
that  are  not  explicitly  embodied  in  the  deal  agreement  or  those
which  succeed  the  original  commitments  of  the  transaction.  The
concessions to be granted in this case should be judged in the light
of traditions, practice and professional experience, and subjected to
clearance by the Shariah Supervisory Board of the Institution.
5/2  Concessions granted to implicit and subsidiary contracts comprise
relief from the following impermissible acts:
5/2/1 Gharar, which affects financial contracts, may be overlooked
in implicit and subsidiary contracts.
5/2/2 Jahalah, which also affects financial contracts, may be ignored
with regard to the object of a subsidiary contract.
654654
Shariah Standard No. (25): Combination of Contracts
5/2/3 Sale-based Riba and violation of currency exchange rules (as
when  spot  delivery  is  ignored  in  a  contract  that  combines
currency exchange with money transfer) are also forgivable
in subsidiary and implicit contracts.
5/2/4 Selling of a debt for another debt may be ignored when it comes
in the context of a subsidiary contract. A fitting example here is
purchasing (on debt) the shares of an indebted company.
5/2/5 Subsidiary and implicit contracts may also relieved from some
prerequisites that underline the validity of contracts (such as
offer and acceptance) when such relief is dictated by need or
desire to achieve a permissible interest.
Combination of Contracts
6. Prior Agreement (Muwata`ah) for Combination of Contracts
6. Prior Agreement (Muwata`ah) for
6/1  Muwata`ah or Tawatu in Fiqh terminology has several meanings;
most important among which are stated below:
6/1/1 Explicit or implicit intention of the parties to the contract to use
a certain trick for practicing Riba through a Shariah accepted
contractual form.
6/1/2  An unrevealed prior agreement between the two parties to per-
form a Shariah-permissible act or deal for the sake of finding
a Shariah-accepted exit (acceptable trick).
6/1/3 Coincidence of the intentions of parties to the contract at the
stage of preparatory negotiations that precede the signing of
the contract as indicated in item (2/2/4) above.
6/2  In Fiqh perception, Muwata`ah for combining contracts has three
distinct characteristics:
6/2/1 It is an agreement between two parties to conclude contracts
and fulfill pledges in the future.
6/2/2  When Muwata`ah is stipulated as part of the contract it becomes
a condition precedent to the conclusion of the contract, and the
contract  becomes  subject  to  the  relevant  Shariah  rulings  with
regard to permissibility, enforceability, and validity.
655655
Shariah Standard No. (25): Combination of Contracts
6/2/3 Enforceability of Muwata`ah in Shariah is similar to enforce-
ability  of  conditions  precedent  to  the  signing  of  contracts.
A condition that precedes the signing of the contract has the
same validity and binding nature of the normal conditions of
the contract, since the former constitutes the bases of the con-
tract  that  have  been  mutually  agreed  upon  between  the  two
parties.
6/3  Muwata`ah to combine contracts takes several forms, which may be
grouped into the following four types:
6/3/1 Muwata`ah to form up Riba tricks, in which the two parties
 or its reverse, or
Bay al-Inah or its reverse, or
agree to practice, for instance, Bay al-Inah
agree to practice, for instance,
Bay  al-Wafa`
.  In  this  case,
Riba  al-Fadl.  In  this  case,
Bay  al-Wafa`  (  (Bay  al-Raja`
Shariah prohibits Muwata`ah and the contract so designed is
invalid.
Bay  al-Raja`),  or
),  or  Riba  al-Fadl
6/3/2  Muwata`ah for Riba excuses is prohibited by Shariah whereby
the two parties agree to combine a loan with another transaction,
or stipulate that the borrower has to present a gift to the lender,
or make excess repayment in terms of quantity or quality.
6/3/2/1 Prohibition  of  Muwata`ah  to  use  such  tricks,  which
are permissible in principle, should be judged in the
light of two conditions:
First,
First, the intention to use the permissible act as a means
 the intention to use the permissible act as a means
of concluding a prohibited deal should be obvious and
beyond all doubts.
  there  should  be  no  obvious  need  or  lawful
Second,  there  should  be  no  obvious  need  or  lawful
Second,
interest that justifies resorting to such a trick.
6/3/3 Muwata`ah for obtaining Shariah Exits, which refers to tricks
that do not violate Shariah rules, or contradict with Shariah
objectives, or result in any harm to others, is permissible.
6/3/4 Muwata`ah for combining contracts that contradict to or op-
pose each other is prohibited because it leads to performing of
an act that has been strictly banned by Shariah. [see item 4/4]
656656
Shariah Standard No. (25): Combination of Contracts
7. Contemporary Applications and General Rules for Combination of
Contracts
7/1  One of the most distinguishable forms of contemporary financial trans-
actions is the contractual arrangements which comprise a number of
contracts and pledges that the parties agree beforehand to execute in
a specific manner and according to agreed number of successive stag-
es.  Such  arrangements  aim  to  achieve  a  given  purpose  or  interest  of
the parties to the contract such as performing Murabahah on Order of
Purchase, Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, or Diminishing Musharakah.
7/2  Muwata`ah, when provided for in the contract and used for combi-
nation of contracts, should be observed by, and remain binding to
the parties to the contract, subject to permissible commercial and
banking conventions. [see item 6/2/2]
7/3  The pledges contained in such combined contract sets are binding to
their respective parties.
7/4  These  newly  devised  sets  of  combined  contracts  should  observe  the
general rules of Shariah with regard to structure, rulings, requirements
and conditions in order to be Shariah compliant. [see item 5/2]
7/5  These contract sets should also observe the Shariah rulings pertain-
ing to combination of contracts, and may make use of the Shariah
concessions in this respect.
7/6  Failure  of  any  of  the  parties  to  combined  contracts  to  honor  its
contractual  commitments  gives  the  other  party  right  of  claiming
indemnity for the actual injury encountered.

for this is that the buyer may have taken into consideration (at the time of
making his offer) the amount of money the slave could have, be it big or

Bay al-Kali` Bil-Kali` (selling a debt for another debt) in

Al-Muwatta` the permissibility of selling a slave and providing in the
contract for the status of the money he owns, even if that money is a debt
owed to the slave by a third party and the slave is himself sold on deferred
payment.  That  is  to  say,  Malik  seems  to  have  based  his  opinion  on  the

  Muwata`ah  for  combining  contracts  is  considered  as  an  enforceable
Muwata`ah  for  combining  contracts  is  considered  as  an  enforceable
condition that precedes the signing of the contract, because Muwata`ah,
traditionally as well as in fiqh terminology, is an agreement between the
two parties to sign contracts and honor pledges in the future. Therefore
Ibn Taymiyyah said, When the two parties agree beforehand to do specific
things, and then sign a general contract, the contract should honor that

  A  condition  that  precedes  the  contract  should  be  regarded  as  binding
A  condition  that  precedes  the  contract  should  be  regarded  as  binding
and enforceable as a one that comes in the text of the contract, because
traditionally there is no difference between the conditions stated in the
contract and those agreed upon beforehand, even if such prior conditions
are not mentioned at the time of signing the contract. This is only natural
since  these  conditions  form  the  bases  of  the  contract,  which  the  two
parties have agreed to observe. This viewpoint is supported by a number
of traditionally accepted norms such as:
A condition, which the two parties agree to observe, resembles a one

Muwata`ah in this sense is part of a whole system that tends to completely

since,  according  to  its  nature  and  Fiqh  status,  and  as  perceived  by  most
of the Fuqaha, such pledges are similar to the conditions stipulated in the
agreement.  Enforceability  of  such  pledges  also  stems  from  the  fact  that
they constitute the basis for the transaction. It is well known that Shariah-
accepted conditions stipulated in a contract are binding from both the fiqhi
as well as the legal viewpoints. Moreover, in present day commercial and
banking traditions, such pledges are also considered as binding. Otherwise,
it will not be possible for the two parties to form up a definite perception
about the purpose and objectives of the contract, and hence they will not
be able to sign it.

permissible practices that can be used for committing Shariah-restricted
acts. However, prohibition in this sense is subject to two restrictions. The
first is the existence of a clear intention of the person in question to use
the  permissible  practice  for  the  sake  of  accomplishing  Shariah-banned
objectives, and the second is that resorting to prohibition should be only
after wide spread of such misconduct in the society.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiary  contracts  or  objectives  in  financial  transactions  refer  to  the
consequent contracts or objectives that follow the original ones. The subsid-
iary status of these contracts or objectives is usually determined according to
tradition, practice and the experience of those who are in the field.
Transaction
It is a binding contractual relationship that carries no optional choices.
Inah
It is a sale whereby one party, for instance, sells the commodity to the
other for one hundred dollars, on deferred payment basis, and repurchases it
from the other for eighty dollars payable on spot. In fact, the sale transaction
here  is  nothing  but  a  mere  trick  for  practicing  usurious  lending,  and  the
commodity  is  used  for  no  purpose  other  than  facilitating  the  usurious
transaction.  The  deal  in  this  case  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  purposes
and  objectives  of  sale,  nor  does  it  contain  any  element  of  them.  In  other
words Inah takes place when one party buys a commodity from the other
669669
Shariah Standard No. (25): Combination of Contracts
on deferred payment basis and before making payment sells back the same
commodity to the other for a less amount of money payable on spot.
Reverse Inah
It takes place when one party sells the commodity to the other party for
a spot price, and the seller repurchases the same commodity from the buyer
or from his agent for a higher deferred price.
Bay al-Wafa`)
Bay al-Raja` ( (Bay al-Wafa`
Bay al-Raja`
It is a sale whereby the seller keeps the intention to buy back his sold
commodity. One of the most popular forms of this type of sale is when
one party, who wants to obtain an interest-bearing loan, agrees to sell an
income-earning asset to the lender. The lender will thus become entitled
to  the  income  of  the  asset  as  long  as  it  remains  in  his  ownership.  The
buyer  then  undertakes  to  return  the  sold  asset  to  the  seller  whenever
the seller pays back the same price to him. In this manner, the borrower
(artificial buyer) succeeds to get the loan amount against payment of the
agreed upon interest.
Shariah-Banned Tricks
It refers to those permissible contractual arrangements and other practices,
which may be used to achieve prohibited goals like permitting what Shariah
has prohibited, like escaping duties, deceiving people and performing other
Shariah-banned practices.
Shariah Exit (Shariah-Acceptable Trick)
A Shariah exit is an act that is performed for the sake of avoiding com-
mitment of sins, or achieving a permissible objective, or refraining from
prohibited acts, or realizing a Shariah-acceptable interest.
Separation of the Transaction
Separation of a transaction means dividing the object of the same contract,
into portions. To Fuqaha, it means a situation in which the provisions of the
contract do not cover all the components of its object, or they may cover all of
them first, and then shrink down to cover only some of them later on. Thus,
either the single transaction is broken down into a number of portions, or only
670670
Shariah Standard No. (25): Combination of Contracts
some parts of it are separated in this manner. When separation takes place in
this manner in a single transaction between a single buyer and a single seller
and for a single price, the buyer should have the option to conclude the deal
or not.

Preface
The purpose of this standard is to present the Shariah rules that govern
Islamic Insurance, as well as the characteristics, basic aspects, principles and
types of Islamic Insurance. The standard also aims to indicate the controls
that Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions)(1)(1) should observe
that Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions)
 should observe
in this connection.
(1) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
institutions including Islamic Banks.

Shariah Standard No. (26): Islamic Insurance
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers Islamic Insurance in terms of its definition, Shariah
status, characteristics, principles, basic elements, types, and how it differs
from  Conventional  Insurance.  The  Standard  also  sets  out  the  controls
to  be  observed  by  the  Islamic  financial  Institutions  offering  products
based on Islamic insurance. However, it does not cover social insurance
schemes arranged by the state.
2. Definition of Islamic Insurance in Contrast with Conventional Insur-
ance
Islamic Insurance is a process of agreement among a group of persons to
handle the injuries resulting from specific risks to which all of them are
vulnerable. A process, thus initiated, involves payment of contributions
as donations, and leads to the establishment of an insurance fund that
enjoys the status of a legal entity and has independent financial liability.
The resources of this fund are used to indemnify any participant who
encounters injury, subject to a specific set of rules and a given process
of  documentation.  The  fund  is  managed  by  either  a  selected  group  of
policyholders,  or  a  joint  stock  company  that  manages  the  insurance
operations and invests the assets of the fund, against a specific fee.
  As for Conventional Insurance, it is a Muawadah (mutual compensation)
contract that seeks to make profit out of the insurance operation itself,
and, hence, is subject to Shariah rulings on financial dealings that involve
Gharar (uncertainty). Consequently, conventional insurance is banned
by Shariah.
3. Status of Islamic Insurance According to Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence)
Islamic  insurance  is  based  on  the  commitment  of  the  participants  to
make  donations  for  the  sake  of  their  own  interest.  The  participants,
678678
Shariah Standard No. (26): Islamic Insurance
therefore, protect their group by payment of contributions that constitute
the resources of the insurance fund, and assign the management of that
fund to a committee of policyholders, or to a joint stock company that
possesses the license of practicing insurance business. In the latter case,
the company assumes this job on the basis of a remunerated Wakalah
(Agency)  contract.  In  addition  to  managing  the  insurance  operations,
the  committee  of  policyholders  or  the  company  also  assumes  the
responsibility of investing the assets of the fund through Mudarabah or
investment agency.
3/1  The managing company is entitled to its own capital and returns on
capital, the agency fee, and its specific share of the profits earned by
investing  the  insurance  assets  through  Mudarabah  or  investment
agency.  The  company  also  bears  all  the  expenses  of  its  operations
including those relating to its tasks for investing the insurance assets.
3/2  The policyholders fund is entitled to the contributions and the returns
thereon, the provisions and reserves relating to insurance business, and
the insurance surplus. The fund bears all direct expenses pertaining to
management of insurance operations.
4. Contractual Relationships in Islamic Insurance
  There are three contractual relationships in Islamic insurance, including:
4/1  The Musharakah (partnership) among the participants, which leads
to the establishment of a company that has articles of association and
all other documents. The relationship between the participants may
be  confined  to  a  Musharakah  contract  if  a  company  manages  the
fund.  [see  Shariah  Standard  No.  (12),  on  Sharikah  (Musharakah)
and Modern Corporations]
4/2  The relationship between the company and the policyholders fund
which  is  a  Wakalah  relationship  in  regard  to  management,  and
a  Mudarabah  or  investment  agency  relationship  in  regard  to  the
investment of the funds assets.
4/3  The  relationship  between  the  policy  holders  and  the  fund  which
takes  the  form  of  donation  commitment  at  the  stage  of  making
679679
Shariah Standard No. (26): Islamic Insurance
contribu
tions, and indemnification commitment at the stage of pro-pro-
contributions, and indemnification commitment at the stage of
viding compensation for injury as per regulations and underlying
constituent documents.
5. Principles and Shariah Bases of Islamic Insurance
Islamic  insurance  is  based  on  the  following  principles  and  rules  of
Shariah, which shall be explicitly mentioned in the articles of association
or the rules or the documents of the corporation:
5/1  Donation commitment, as it should be stipulated that the participant
donates his contribution and the returns thereon to the insurance
account for payment of indemnity, and may undertake to bear any
deficit that may occur, as per regulations.
5/2  The company that arranges the insurance deal should maintain two
separate accounts: one for its own rights and liabilities, and the other
for the rights and liabilities of the policyholders.
5/3  The company should assume the role of the agent in managing the
insurance account, and the role of the Mudarib or agent in investing
the insurance assets.
5/4  The insurance account is entitled to the insurance assets and their
returns  on  investment,  and  should  bear  the  liabilities  relating  to
these assets.
5/5  The  adopted  rules  may  comprise  disposal  of  the  surplus  in  a  way
that serves the cause of common interest of the participants, such as
accumulation of reserves, reduction of the contribution, charitable
donations  and  partial/full  distribution  of  the  surplus  among  the
participants. The managing company is not entitled to any share of
the surplus.
5/6  When the company is liquidated, all provisions and accumulated
reserves pertaining to insurance should be spent on charitable pur-
poses.
5/7  Preference should be given to policyholders to participate in manage-
ment of the insurance operations through appropriate legal arrange-
protect
ments  that  enable  them  to  exercise  their  control  rights  and  protect
ments  that  enable  them  to  exercise  their  control  rights  and
680680
Shariah Standard No. (26): Islamic Insurance
their interest. Such arrangements could include, among others, repre-
sentation of policyholders in the Board of Directors.
 5/8 Company shall adhere to the rules and principles of Islamic Shariah
in  all  its  activities  and  investments,  especially  in  refraining  from
provision of insurance coverage for Shariah-banned items, activities
or purposes.
5/9  A Shariah Supervisory Board shall be formulated for issuance of
Fatawa  (plural:  Fatwa,  i.  e.  juristic  opinion)  that  are  binding  to
the  company,  and  establishment  of  an  internal  unit  for  Shariah
monitoring and auditing.
6. Types of Islamic Insurance
6/1  Property  Insurance:  which  entails  indemnification  for  actual  injury,
and comprises insurance against fire, car accidents, airplane accidents,
liability,  breach  of  trust,  etc.  [See  Shariah  Standard  No.  (5)  on
Guarantees  item 6/4]
6/2  Person Insurance: which includes insurance against the risk of disability
  (mutual  support).  It
Takaful  (mutual  support).  It
and  death,  and  is  sometimes  known  as
and  death,  and  is  sometimes  known  as  Takaful
corresponds to conventional life insurance.
6/2/1 Insurance against the risk of disability or death takes place as
follows:
6/2/1/1 Submission of a request for participation indicating
all personal affairs and characteristics, that need to
be known for offering the insurance coverage to the
insured, along with the particulars of the entitlements
and obligations of the insured.
6/2/1/2 Specification of the contribution amount.
6/2/1/3 Specification of the benefits payable to the beneficiary
as per agreement.
6/2/1/4 In  case  of  death,  the  Takaful
6/2/1/4 In  case  of  death,  the
  entitlements  should  be
Takaful  entitlements  should  be
distributed  among  the  deserving  persons,  parties  or
purposes as indicated in the documents, and accord-
681681
Shariah Standard No. (26): Islamic Insurance
ing to
the regulatory rules issued by the Shariah Su-
ing to the regulatory rules issued by the Shariah Su-
pervisory Board. In case the deceased was entitled to
some  investment  balances,  then  the  same  should  be
distributed among the inheritors according to the Is-
lamic rules of inheritance.
6/2/1/5 In case of insurance against death, it should be stip-
ulated  in  the  insurance  policy  that  the  insured  (the
beneficiary)  or  his  inheritor  should  not  be  entitled
to  any  compensation  when  the  death  is  caused  by
a murder wherein the said beneficiary or inheritor is
involved.
7. Participation in Islamic Insurance
7/1  Non-Muslims may participate with Muslims in the various types of
Islamic insurance.
7/2  The  contribution  may  be  determined  according  to  the  actuarial
principles  based  on  statistical  techniques.  In  this  regard,  due  con-
sideration should be given to whether the risk involved is fixed or
variable, and to the contribution/risk tradeoff besides determination
of the type and period of the risk coverage, and specification of the
insurance amount.
7/3  The risk that constitutes the subject matter of insurance should be
one that could probably occur. It should not be something that relates
to the absolute will of the participant, and should not encounter any
Shariah prohibition.
8. Commitments of the Participant in Islamic Insurance
  The participant (insurance seeker) should observe the following commit-
ments:ments:
8/1  Submission of the required information about the risks to be insured
against, and informing the company of any new circumstances that
may increase these risks after concluding the contract. If it is proved
that  the  participant  had  committed  fraud  or  deceit,  or  submitted
false  information,  he  is  then  subject  to  partial  or  full  deprivation
682682
Shariah Standard No. (26): Islamic Insurance
from  indemnity.  In  case  of  unintentional  misrepresentation  by  the
participant, the indemnity shall become proportionate to the accurate
information he presented.
8/2  Payment of contribution on time as per agreement. If the participant
refrains from or delays payment of his contribution, the company
has the right to terminate the contract or pursue legal enforcement
of payment.
8/3  Informing the company, in its capacity as an agent of the policyholders
fund, of occurrence of the risk insured. Notification should be made
during  the  period  stipulated  in  the  insurance  policy,  or  within
reasonable time if such period is not provided for in the policy. If
the participant fails to make such notification, the company has the
right to claim indemnity from him for the actual loss incurred by the
insurance account due to such breach of commitment.
9. Conditions in Islamic Insurance Policies
9/1  There is no Shariah restriction on providing for special conditions in
the insurance policy. Special conditions may relate to periods of insur-
ance, denial of indemnity in specific cases as when the participant fails
to notify the company about occurrence of risk on time, or charging
the participant with a specific portion of the indemnity. A condition
thus stipulated in the insurance policy remains binding as long as it
does not contradict with the rules of Shariah or the prerequisites of the
contract.
9/2  It is permissible to stipulate in the insurance policy special cases that
lead to deprivation from indemnity provided that justice, preservation
of rights, and avoidance of abusive conditions are well observed.
10. Commitments and Jurisdictions of the Joint Stock Company
10/1  The  Company  shall  assume  the  various  tasks  of  managing  the
insurance operations including; preparation of insurance policies,
collection of contributions, payment of indemnities, and all other
technical tasks. The Company performs such tasks against a specific
fee, which should be stated in the agreement in order to obtain the

Shariah Standard No. (26): Islamic Insurance
10/2  The  Company  is  entrusted  with  the  duty  of  achieving  common

operations. However, it should not guarantee the insurance assets
except in case of misconduct, negligence or breach of contractual
obligations.
10/3  The Company shall bear its pre-operating expenses as well as all
other expenses that relate to conducting its own business or the
investment of its own funds.
10/4  The statutory reserve of the Joint Stock Company is deducted from
its share capital and becomes part of its shareholders equity, a case
that  also  holds  true  for  all  other  capital-related  deductions.  No
deduction shall be made from the policyholders fund or profits for
the benefit of the shareholders of the Joint Stock Company.
10/5  For the sake of serving the policyholders interest, it is permissible
to deduct part of their funds or profits to be used as reserves or
allocations  pertaining  to  the  insurance  fund.  Such  deductions,
however, should by no means belong to the shareholders of the
Joint Stock Company. The accumulated balance of the insurance
account shall be spent on charity purposes in case of liquidation.
10/6  The Company claims indemnity from the party who causes the
injury,  whether  through  breach  of  contractual  commitment  or
any  similar  misbehavior.  In  this  case,  the  Company  represents
the participants in disposing of all the tasks that relate to the case,
such as filing of lawsuits, realization of the consequent rights, and
depositing the proceeds in the insurance account.
10/7  When  the  Company  invests  the  policyholders  funds  through
Mudarabah, it should bear the expenses that are normally borne
by the Mudarib [see Shariah Standard No. (13) on Mudarabah].
However, if the Company invests such funds through investment
agency, the deal shall be subject to Shariah rulings on remunerated
agency.

insurance companies fall short of covering indemnity commitments,
the Company may cover the deficit from project financing or Qard Qard
the Company may cover the deficit from project financing or
HasanHasan  (interest-free  or  benevolent  loan)  debited  to  the  account
  (interest-free  or  benevolent  loan)  debited  to  the  account
of  the  insurance  fund.  In  this  regard,  the  deficits  resulting  from
commitments of the current year may be covered from the surpluses
of  the  succeeding  years.  The  Company  may  also  claim  settlement
of the deficit from policyholders if they undertake to do so in the
insurance policy.
 10/9 The  insurance  account  shall  bear  all  the  expenses  and  fees  that
relate to insurance activities.
10/10 There is no Shariah restriction on reconciling between the Company
and the party who causes the injury, if such reconciliation is in the
interest of the participants, and conforms to the relevant Shariah
rulings.
11. Indemnity
11/1  The participant shall receive either the loss, he incurred because of
the injury, or the insurance amount; whichever is less, and as per
regulations.
11/2  The  participant  should  not  receive  both  the  indemnity  and  the
compensation from other parties for injury caused to him.
11/3  In  Property  Insurance,  indemnity  should  be  confined  to  what  has
been provided for in the regulations, and may comprise subsidiary
losses  that  can  be  appropriately  estimated  according  to  the  actual
injury.
12. Insurance Surplus
12/1  The insurance surplus is part of the assets of the insurance account
and should be disposed of according to what has been stated in
item 5/5 of this Standard.

should be in one of the following forms, provided that the selected
form is explicitly mentioned in the regulations:

whether  the  policyholder  has  received  indemnity  during  the
financial period or not.
12/2/2 Distribution  of  the  surplus  among  the  policyholders  who
have not received indemnity during the financial period.
12/2/3 Distribution  of  the  surplus  among  policyholders  after
deducting the amounts of indemnity they receive during the
same financial period.
12/2/4 Distribution  through  any  other  method  approved  by  the
Shariah Supervisory Board.
13. Expiry of Insurance Policy
  The insurance policy expires in any of the following cases:
13/1  At the end of the period agreed upon in the insurance policy. In
case  of  property  insurance,  it  is  permissible  to  stipulate  that  the
contract is automatically renewable unless the participant informs
the company, within a specific period before expiry of the contract,
of his desire to cease contracts renewal.
13/2  Termination of the policy by the company or the participant, if the
policy provides for the right of termination to each of the parties
to contract.
13/3  Complete  damage  of  the  insured  property  (in  case  of  property
insurance), without nullifying the entitlement of the participant
to the indemnity, subject to the contracts conditions.

without nullifying the entitlement of the beneficiary to the in-
surance benefits, subject to the contracts conditions.

the Preparation of the Standard
The Shariah Board decided in its meeting No. (8) held on 28 Safar  4
Rabi I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., in Makkah Al-
Mukarramah to issue a Shariah Standard on Islamic Insurance.
On 12 Jumada I, 1424 A.H., 12 July 2003 A.D., the Shariah Standards
Committee decided to commission a Shariah consultant to prepare a draft
standard on Islamic Insurance.
In its meeting No. (10) held on 2324 Jumada II, 1424 A.H., corresponding
to 2324 July 2003 A.D., in Amman, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
the  Shariah  Standards  Committee  (1)  discussed  the  Shariah  study  and
advised the consultant to incorporate the necessary changes, in the light of
the discussions and observations of its members.
The Shariah Standards Committee (1) once again discussed the draft of
the Standard in its meeting No. (11) held on 2526 Safar 1425 A.H., corre-
sponding to 15-6 April 2004 A.D., in the Kingdom of Bahrain and incor-
porated further changes in it. The committee also requested the consultant
to  review  the  document  on  the  light  of  the  discussions  and  incorporate
necessary changes.
A  third  round  of  discussions  on  and  amendments  in  the  draft  of  the
Standard  also  took  place  in  meeting  No.  (12)  of  the  Shariah  Standards
Committee (1) held on 28 Rabi II, 1425 A.H., corresponding to 16 June
2004 A.D. in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The revised version of the Standard was then submitted to the Shariah
Board  in  its  meeting  No.  (13)  held  in  Makkah  Al-Mukarramah  on  26
Shaban  1 Ramadan 1425 A.H., corresponding to 1015 October 2004

  Permissibility of cooperative insurance and non-permissibility of com-
mercial insurance is in fact due to the following differences:
a)  The conventional insurance contract is a financial Muawadah (exchange
contract)  that  aims  at  making  profit  out  of  the  insurance  operations.
Therefore, its permissibility should be judged in the light of the Shariah
rulings  on  financial  transactions.  Consequently,  such  rulings  prohibit
the conventional insurance contract, which involves Gharar.
b)  In the Islamic insurance contract, the company assumes the role of the
agent of the insurance account, whereas in the commercial insurance
contract the company is an original party that signs the contract in its
own name.
c)  The company in commercial insurance owns the premiums against
its  commitment  to  pay  the  insurance  amount;  whereas  in  Islamic
insurance, it is the insurance account rather than the company that
owns the contributions.
d) In Islamic insurance the residual premiums and the returns on them,
that  remain  after  deduction  of  expenses  and  indemnity  amounts,

become  the  property  of  the  policyholders  account,  and  constitute
a  surplus,  which  can  be  distributed  among  the  policyholders.  This
cannot  be  imagined  in  commercial  insurance  where  the  company
owns and receives the premiums as soon as it signs the contract. In
commercial insurance, the premiums constitute part of the revenue
and profits of the company.
e)  In Islamic insurance, the returns on investment of the premium assets
belong to the policyholders account, after deduction of the Mudarib
share for the company, whereas such returns belong to the company
in commercial insurance.
f)  Islamic insurance aims at achieving cooperation among the members of
the society, rather than generating profits from the insurance operations,
whereas commercial insurance is profit-oriented.
g)  The company in Islamic insurance earns profits through investment
of its own funds and its share in Mudarabah, as it assumes the role of
the Mudarib and the insurance account assumes the role of the Rab
al-Mal (owner of the capital).
h) In Islamic insurance, the insurer and the participant are in fact the
same person although they differ in recognition, whereas the insurer
and the participant are totally different in commercial insurance.
i)  The  company  in  Islamic  insurance  adheres  to  the  rules  of  Islamic
Shariah  and  the  Fatawa  of  its  Shariah  Supervisory  Board,  while  in
commercial insurance there are no such commitments.
j)  In Islamic insurance, the allocations from the insurance account, which
remain there until the time of liquidation of the company, are spent on
charity purposes, and do not go to shareholders, whereas in commercial
insurance such amounts go to shareholders.

Ali and Ibn Masud said: A gift, if specifically defined, is binding, whether
received or not. It has also been narrated that Abu Bakr and Umar indi-
cated that a gift does not become binding before receipt.(7)(7) Malik however
cated that a gift does not become binding before receipt.
 Malik however
reconciled the two viewpoints by indicating that Ali, Ibn Masud and the
others seem to have focused on the fact that the contract as such is bin-
ding,  while  Abu  Bakr  and  Umar  seem  to  have  focused  on  the  fact  that
the receipt of the gift is a prerequisite of finalizing the contract. The lat-
ter viewpoint was justified by the desire to leave no room for an excuse
that Umar explicitly mentioned.(8)(8) The obligatory nature of the donation

 The obligatory nature of the donation

The basis of the Shariah ruling that the company should not guarantee
the  insurance  assets  is  that  the  company  is  an  agent,  and  the  Fuqaha
unanimously  agree  that  an  agent  should  not  guarantee  the  property
except against misconduct, negligence or breach of the contract.
  The justification for stating the nine principles of Islamic insurance in the
The justification for stating the nine principles of Islamic insurance in the
articles of association of the company is the need to preserve the element
of  donation  in  the  contract  and  emphasize  it  as  a  basic  aspect  of  the
company, and hence preserve the cooperative nature and permissibility
of the insurance operation. Otherwise, the insurance operation becomes
a Muawadah transaction, and therefore subject to impact of Gharar as
mentioned  earlier.  In  other  words,  emphasis  on  the  nine  principles  is
because  they  constitute  the  fundamental  differences  between  Islamic

they need during their journey, and leave each of them free to consume the portion of

themselves, unless they decide to keep it for another journey. This is quite similar to
the treatment of the surplus in Islamic Insurance.

Premium
It is the amount of the contribution, which the participant donates, along
with its related profits, for the benefit of the insurance scheme.
Insurance Amount
It is the amount paid by the company out of the insurance account at the
occurrence of the risk insured against.
Risk Insured Against
It is the probable, legally acceptable, accident.
Commercial Insurance
It is a contract between an insured party and a technical insuring body,
stipulating  that  the  former  pays  the  latter  a  specific  number  of  financial
installments or a lump sum amount, against the commitment of the latter
to bear a risk that can be insured against, through payment of an estimated
financial  indemnity  to  the  insured  or  the  beneficiary,  on  the  occurrence
of the risk. [Clause No. (747) of the Egyptian law, Clause No. (773) of the
Kuwaiti Law and Clause No. (983) of the Iraqi Law].
Cooperative Insurance
A collective insurance contract is a contract whereby each participant
undertakes to pay a specific amount of money as donation to indemnify
any member of the group who encounters the risk insured against.
Islamic Insurance
It is a kind of cooperative insurance, which covers all types of risks, un-
der the management of a specialized company that adheres to the rules and
principles of Shariah. In this sense, Islamic insurance differs from coopera-

tive insurance as the latter only covers a specific group of beneficiaries who
might encounter risks, for instance, merchants, sailors and the like while
Islamic insurance is available to the general public. Islamic insurance also
differs from cooperative Insurance with regard to adherence to the rules
and principles of Islamic Shariah as well as in some technical aspects per-
taining to premiums. In cooperative insurance, premiums may be variable
at  the  beginning;  whereas  in  organized  Islamic  insurance,  premiums  are
specific due to use of precise statistical studies.
Mutual Insurance, the Alternate to Life Insurance
It is the insurance that covers the risks of death, inability, injury or illness,
for the individual or the group, through payment of the insurance amount to
the participant or the beneficiary, as per the agreement.
Surplus
The  Surplus  comprises  of  residual  premiums  of  the  participants  (the
insured) in addition to the reserves and profits, after deducting all expenses
and indemnity amounts (paid or payable during the same year). The residual
amount, thus computed, is considered as surplus, rather than profit.

Shariah Standard No. (27): Indices
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers definition of Indices, methods of their calculation,
their  main  types,  their  various  forms  of  applications,  and  the  Shariah
status  of  each  of  these  forms.  The  Standard  also  sets  out  the  Shariah
rulings that govern Indices.
2. Definition and Main Applications of the Index
1/2  An Index is a statistically computed figure based on a selected package
of financial papers or commodities dealt in organized or non-organized
financial markets, or in both. Each paper/commodity is given a specific
weight, according to its market value, and the total value is divided by
a  constant  figure.  Among  the  best-known  indices  at  present  are  the
Consumer  Price  Index,  and  the  Dow  Jones  and  FTSE  indices  in  the
financial markets.
2/2 An  Index  that  is  well  designed  to  measure  the  market  situation,
indicates the general economic situation of the country, and may
help in forecasting its future developments before any change takes
place  and,  thus,  facilitates  investment  decisions.  An  index  may
also provide a signal to investors about the future movement of the
prices of financial papers, or demonstrate a certain downward or
upward trend of such prices. Due to the inconsistency that might
occur  between  one  index  and  another,  indices  are  used  besides
other analytical methods, as well as the experience and knowledge
about  the  market  situations  and  the  predominant  models  of
transactions.
2/3  The upward and downward movements of an index reveal the di-
rections of the market, and hence the market is denoted as a rising
or a declining market.
706706
Shariah Standard No. (27): Indices
3. Bases of Calculation and Characteristics of Indices
3/1  Calculation of indices is a process that depends on several aspects
including past and current price forecasts, market projections, time
intervals, upper and lower limits of dealing prices, and display charts.
3/2  Indices differ from each other in several aspects such as the components
of the index or the type of data it attempts to summarize, the weight
it assigns to each component, and the method of calculation thereof.
There  are,  however,  some  common  characteristics  among  all  well-
known indices in the capital and commodity markets, regardless of
the data that each index attempts to analyze. Most important among
these characteristics are accuracy, objectivity and transparency.
  Accuracy  refers  to  proper  specification  of  the  components  of  the
index, sources of its data input, time of obtaining the data, method
of calculating the weights, and basis of rounding off the numbers.
  Objectivity entails presentation of the detailed calculations of the index
to leave no room for difference of opinion with regard to determination
of the value of the index on a specific date or at a specific place.
  Transparency entails pre-specification of the time, place, and method
of announcing the readings of the index so that the process does not
involve Jahalah
involve
 (ignorance or uncertainty).
Jahalah (ignorance or uncertainty).
3/3  There are some general principles that govern almost all indices,
such as:
3/3/1 The absolute value of the index has no implication when pre-
sented  as  a  single  figure.  The  value  of  the  index,  at  a  given
point  of  time,  becomes  meaningful  only  when  compared  to
the past and future values of the index. Only then, the trend
and  percentage  of  change  may  be  observed.  For  instance,
an increase of 9 points in the value of the index may represent
2% of its previous value.
3/3/2 The values of the index at different periods may be multiplied
or divided by any constant figure (i.e., increasing or decreasing
707707
Shariah Standard No. (27): Indices
the figures of the index by the same percentage like division of
shares), without   affecting  the  accuracy  of  its  implications.
That  is  to  say,  the  implications  of  the  index  are  confined  to
what  it  represents  of  the  average  upwards  and  downwards
changes in the weights of its components from time to time.
4. Types of Indices
Indices are classified according to different considerations:
4/14/1  With regard to their general or specific nature, indices may be clas-
 With regard to their general or specific nature, indices may be clas-
sified into the following categories:
General Indices that measure the market situation in general.

sector or industry, such as the transport sector.

 Indices that precede price movements may be classified, with regard
to central and area fluctuations, into the following categories:
  Centered Oscillating Indices, which measure price changes du-
Centered Oscillating Indices, which measure price changes du-
ring a specific period in the past, and indicate probable future
events.
Ranged  Oscillating  Indices  (band)  that  fluctuate  between  two
  Ranged  Oscillating  Indices  (band)  that  fluctuate  between  two
areas, like overbuying or overselling.
5. Permissible Methods of Using Indices
5/1  It is permissible in Shariah to use indices to discern the magnitude
of  change  in  a  certain  market,  or  to  judge  the  performance  of
specialized managers by comparing the returns they achieve to the
indices. Indices may be used to form up an idea about a portfolio or to
estimate its systematic risks instead of monitoring the performance
and risks of each financial paper independently. Moreover, Indices
may also be used for forecasting the future situation of the market
and discovering the pattern of changes that the market may undergo.
Therefore, using indices for guidance in operations that relate to real
transactions is permissible in Shariah.
5/2  It  is  permissible  to  use  indices  as  a  benchmark  for  comparison  of
funds and investment bonds, or for correlating the remuneration of
708708
Shariah Standard No. (27): Indices
the manager or the bonus of the agent to the investment, or the
bonus
the manager or the bonus of the agent to the investment, or the bonus
of the Mudarib to the results of the Mudarabah.
5/3  It  is  permissible  to  use  an  index  like  LIBOR,  or  a  certain  share/
commodity  price  index,  as  a  basis  for  determining  the  profit  of
a Murabahah pledge, provided that the contract is to be concluded
on a specific profit that does not vary with further changes in the
index. [see Shariah Standard No. (8) on Murabahah  Item 4/6]
5/4  It  is  permissible  to  use  the  index  to  determine  the  portion  of  the
variable
 (rent) that represents the return. [see Shariah Standard
variable UjrahUjrah (rent) that represents the return. [see Shariah Standard
No. (9) on Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek  para 5/2/3]
5/5  It  is  permissible  that  work  rules,  regulations  and  the  arrange-
ments,
pertaining to money-based employment contracts, stipulate
ments, pertaining to money-based employment contracts, stipulate
a  provision  on  wage  indexation.Wage  indexation  here  refers  to
periodical adjustment of wages according to changes in the price
level, as determined by the concerned bodies. However, in case of
accumulation of unpaid wage that takes the form of debt, Shariah
rulings on debts should be observed.
5/6  It is permissible to link the deals to be undertaken by the Mudarib or
the agent to a specific index, so that he can dispose of the commodity
at  the  market  price  when  the  index  reaches  a  certain  reading,  or
purchase a certain amount of the commodity at a specific reading of
the index.
5/7  It is permissible to connect the fulfillment of a binding pledge on the
part of a buyer or a seller to the rate of increase or decrease of a specific
index in comparison to the price of the commodity at a particular date,
so that any further increase may be added to the price of the commodity.
5/8  It is permissible to link the amount of a donation to a charitable body,

in case of delayed settlement, with a particular index, at one end.

6. Impermissible Methods of Using Indices
6/1  Shariah  prohibits  trading  in  indices  or  taking  advantage  of  their
changes  in  the  financial  markets,  through  payment  or  receipt  of
709709
Shariah Standard No. (27): Indices
money on the mere occurrence of certain readings of the index, and
without selling or buying the real assets which the index represents
or any other assets. Such dealing is prohibited even if it is practiced
for the sake of hedging against potential risk.
6/2  It is prohibited in Shariah to conclude option contracts on indices.
[see Shariah Standard No. (20) on Sale of Commodities in Organized
Markets  item 5/2]
6/3 It is also prohibited in Shariah to conclude contracts on the Index
Contracts Multiplier.
6/4  It is also prohibited in Shariah to link a contract that should not be
suspended, like selling, to a specific index.
6/5  It is prohibited in Shariah to connect the amount of a cash debt, at
the time of lending, to the price index.
7. Development of an Islamic Index
  The  following  points  should  be  observed  while  developing  an  Islamic
Index:
7/1  Adherence to Shariah precepts, in addition to the technical controls
relating to the components of the index, and its applications.
7/2  There should be a Shariah Supervisory Board for the Index, to ensure
observation of the Shariah precepts in the components and applica-
tions  of  the  index,  and  to  conduct  periodical  review  and  reporting
relating thereto.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
The Shariah board decided in its meeting No. (8) held on 28 Safar  4
Rabi I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., in Makkah
Al-Mukarramah, to issue a Shariah Standard on Indices.
On  12  Jumada  I,  1424  A.H.,  corresponding  to  12  July  2003  A.D.,  the
Shariah Standards Committee decided to commission a Shariah consultant
to prepare a draft Standard on Indices.
The  Committee  (2)  discussed  the  draft  Standard  in  its  meeting  No.
(15)  held  in  Manama,  Kingdom  of  Bahrain,  on  8  Jumada  I,  1426  A.H.,
corresponding to 15 June 2005 A.D., and made necessary changes thereto
in the light of the discussions and comments of its members.
The  Committee  (2)  once  again  discussed  the  draft  Standard  in  its
meeting No. (16) held in Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain, on 45 Shaban
1426 A.H., corresponding to 8-9 September 2005 A.D., and incorporated
necessary changes therein in the light of the discussions and observations
of the meeting.
The revised draft of the Standard was submitted to the Shariah Board
in its meeting No. (15) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 2226 Shaban
1426  A.H.,  corresponding  to  26-30  September  2005  A.D.  The  Shariah
Board decided to send the draft Standard to specialized experts for review
and comments before discussing it in a public hearing.
AAOIFI  held  a  public  hearing  in  the  Kingdom  of  Bahrain,  on  1  Safar
1427 A.H., corresponding to 1 March 2006 A.D. More than 30 participants
representing central banks, Institutions, accounting firms, Shariah scholars,
academics and other interested parties attended the public hearing. Several
712712

observations were made in the session to which members of the Shariah
Standards Committees (1) and (2) duly responded.
The draft Standard was presented to the Drafting Committee in a meeting
held in Kingdom of Bahrain on 1 Safar 1427 A.H., corresponding to 1 March
2006 A.D., and several amendments were proposed in the meeting.
The Shariah Board discussed in its meeting No. (16) held in Al-Madinah
Al-Munawwarah, on 7-12 Jumada I, 1427 A.H., corresponding to 3-9 June
2006  A.D.,  the  amendments  proposed  by  the  Drafting  Committee  and
accepted some of them. The Shariah Board then approved the Standard,
unanimously for some of its clauses and by majority for others, as indicated
in the minutes of the Boards meetings.

  Developing  indices  is  permissible  in  Shariah  because  they  constitute
Developing  indices  is  permissible  in  Shariah  because  they  constitute
a method of forecasting and a means of observing the state of circums-
tances (inferences). Resorting to inferences is a well-recognized practice
in judicature and financial transactions. Ibn Al-Qayyim in his book on
Judicial Methods presented a number of proofs on permissibility of using
inferences.
  Permissibility of using indices to forecast the market situation is derived
Permissibility of using indices to forecast the market situation is derived
from acceptability of using inferences for judgment. As indicated above,
Shariah  does  not  object  to  using  inferences  to  make  current  or  future
judgment based on past events, or to initiate practical actions in the light
of probable developments.

  Selling  or  buying  indices  is  prohibited  because  it  is  nothing  more  than
payment or receipt of money for the mere existence of a certain reading
or  figure.  Such  an  act  constitutes  a  form  of  gambling  and  an  illegal  act
of  gaining  money.  Hence,  prohibition  of  selling  or  buying  indices  has
been well emphasized by the Resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh
Academy  which  states  that  it  is  not  permissible  to  sell  or  buy  an  index,
because this constitutes pure gambling. It is an act of selling an imaginary
object that never exists.(2)(2)

rather than with real commodities. Moreover, prohibition of dealing in

The justification for periodical adjustment of wages subject to changes in
the level of prices is to pursue application of a fair wage policy, and protect
the money income of the employees against deterioration of purchasing
power due to inflation. It is permissible to provide for such a condition in
the contract because conditions between contracting parties are permis-
sible in principle, unless they lead to reversing what has been permitted
or prohibited by Shariah.

Definitions
Index Multiplier
A specific ratio added to the difference in the price of the index on expiry
of the date of the transaction.
Centered Oscillating Indices
These are the indices that fluctuate around a given center or point. They
measure price change in a past period, and are used for forecasting probable
future  events.  Such  indices  precede  market  movements  and  measure  the
rate of price change during the period under study.
Ranged Oscillating Indices
These are indices that fluctuate between two specific ranges, such as the
limit of overbuying and the limit of overselling.
Benchmark
It refers to any index that represents the performance of a whole industry
or a particular activity. It can be used as a standard for measuring the per-
formance of investment funds and investment units, or used as an indicator
for fixing remuneration for management or bonus for the investment agent
or the Mudarib.
Hedging
It is a method for mitigating investment risks (such as market risks) by
using financial instruments available in the market to curb down the risks
that may arise from severe price changes.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard

It is permissible for the Institutions to provide banking services that do
not involve interest-based lending and borrowing, because such services
serve a permissible interest of the clients.
  Institutions may charge fees for providing banking services, because the
Institutions may charge fees for providing banking services, because the

All praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, and blessings and peace be
upon our master, Muhammad, and his household and all his companions
Preface
The  purpose  of  this  standard  is  to  indicate  the  meaning  of  Fatwa
(Shariah opinion), elucidate the eligibility conditions for issuance thereof,
and  define  its  appropriate  means  and  scope.  The  standard  also  aims  to
identify the observed methods of Fatwa presentation and explain how an
erroneous Fatwa can be rectified.
737737
Shariah Standard No. (29): Stipulations and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework
 Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  the  area  of  Fatwa  because  it  is  one  of  the  tasks
assigned to Shariah Supervisory Boards (Board/Boards) of the Islamic
Financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions).(1)(1)
Financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions).
2. Definition of Fatwa and Istifta` (Seeking Fatwa)
2/1  The term Fatwa refers to a Shariah opinion presented to a person
who seeks it with regard to an incidence that has already occurred
(the  Fatwa  incidence)  or  is  expected  to  occur.  It  does  not  refer  to
answering queries pertaining to hypothetical incidences.
2/2  Istifta` refers to the act of seeking the Shariah opinion on an incidence
that has already occurred or expected to occur.
3. Shariah Ruling on Fatwa and Istifta`
3/1  Originally, Fatwa is a collective duty that can be discharged of by any
one of those who are able to do it. Fatwa could, however, become the
personal duty of the individual if he happens to be the only one in
the community who is eligible to issue it.
3/3  The board has to provide Fatwa to the Institution by virtue of their
relationship.
3/4  It is the duty of the Institution to seek Fatwa on incidences that actually
occur  or  are  expected  to  occur.  It  should  also  seek  Fatwa  for  every
operation that it intends to pursue.
3/5  Although  the  seeker  of  the  Fatwa  is  free  to  use  his  best  efforts  to
determine the most appropriate source (both in terms of knowledge
and integrity) from whom he will seek the Fatwa, yet according to
 The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
(1)(1) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
institutions including Islamic Banks.
738738
Shariah Standard No. (29): Stipulations and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework
the rules and regulations, Institutions have to seek Fatwa from their
own boards.
4. Scope of Fatwa (Content)
  Fatwa in Institutions is confined to operational financial rulings and
issues pertaining to them such as some rulings on worshipping, as well
as permissibility and prohibition in some concerns such as Zakah.
5. Conditions on Mufti (Fatwa Issuers)
5/1  A board member shall be well versed in Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence),
well  informed  of  the  contributions  of  diligent  Fiqh  scholars,  and
has  the  ability  to  use  the  Shariah-accepted  methods  of  deriving
reasonable rulings on emerging issues. He shall also be known for his
discernment,  cautiousness  and  knowledge  about  the  circumstances
and traditions of people, and should always remain alert against the
different means of human misbehavior. Competence in Fiqh is usually
manifested by the vast reputation of the scholar or his distinguishable
contributions especially in the area of financial transactions performed
by institutions.
5/2  Issuing Fatwa to institutions does not require competence in all areas
of Fiqh. Fatwa can be issued by a scholar who is competent only in
the area of financial transactions performed by institutions.
5/3  The  member  of  the  Board  shall  have  no  personal  interest  in  the
matter for which the Institution seeks Fatwa.
6. Duties of the Institution That Seeks Fatwa
6/1  The  Institution  is  obliged  to  follow  the  Fatwa  once  it  is  issued
regardless
of whether it meets the satisfaction of the management or
regardless of whether it meets the satisfaction of the management or
not. This obligation holds true when the Fatwa entails enforcement
or prohibition of a certain act. When the Fatwa entails permissibility
of the act in question, the institution has the right to refrain from
following it, if it believes that for practical needs it has to do so. In
this case, however, rejection of the board Fatwa should be reported
to the General Assembly of the institution.
739739
Shariah Standard No. (29): Stipulations and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework
6/2  Fatwa  should  be  sought  again  if  there  are  new  developments  that
should be presented to the Board. New developments may include
change or improvement of conception, occurrence of new circum-
stances, or non-existence of some of the underlying reasons of the
previous Fatwa.
6/3  The institution should not follow the Fatwas of other Shariah Advisory
Boards except with permission of its own Board.
6/4  The institution should not demand Fatwa according to a specific
Madhab
 (School of Fiqh) even if it is the official school in its host
Madhab (School of Fiqh) even if it is the official school in its host
country, or the school that official Fatwa bodies adhere to. However,
attention should be given to situations where the legal or judiciary
system in the country observes a specific school, and the issue in
question may be taken to the courts in the future.
7. Methods and Means of Fatwa
7/1  Fatwa should basically be founded on what has been explicitly stated
in the Qur`an and the Sunnah along with what has been supported
)  or  proved  by  Qiyas  (analogical
consensus  of  Fuqaha)  or  proved  by  Qiyas  (analogical
by  Ijma  (consensus  of  Fuqaha
by  Ijma  (
deduction). After resorting to the preceding sources, the judgment of
the Mufti (issuer of the Fatwa) with regard to the different viewpoints
of the Fuqaha (scholars of Fiqh); i.e, Istihsan (Shariah approbation)
and
 (public interest) may be considered as the
Maslahah Mursalah (public interest) may be considered as the
and Maslahah Mursalah
basis for issuance of Fatwa.
7/2  Fatwa  should  not  be  based  on  a  personal  viewpoint  that  does  not
cater for the sources referred to in item (1/7) above, or contradict
with  the  general  texts  of  the  Qur`an  and  the  Sunnah  that  have
explicit indications. Moreover, Fatwa shall also not fall in disparity
with  well-established  Ijma  or  the  general  rules  derived  from  the
Qur`an and the Sunnah.
7/3  Absence of explicit directives in the Qur`an and Sunnah on a given
issue, or non-existence of the issue in the prevailing Fiqh literature,
do  not  justify  refraining  from  seeking  Fatwa  on  that  issue.  Fatwa
in this case may be derived through Shariah-sanctioned rules and
methods of deduction.
740740
Shariah Standard No. (29): Stipulations and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework
7/4  The  board  may  coordinate  with  the  Institution  to  transfer  the
Fatwa, if necessary, to a board that is considered to be more reliable
due, for instance, to its larger membership, or its inclusion of more
specializations,  such  as  Fiqh  academies,  AAOIFI  Board  and  the
Supreme Shariah boards.
7/5  Among the means that may be used for reaching the appropriate
Shariah ruling on a given issue are the following:
7/5/1 Building  detailed  knowledge  about  the  issue  of  the  Fatwa
through  questioning  the  one  who  seeks  it,  consulting  other
boards, resorting to experts and specialized parties, and taking
into consideration the prevailing norms and tradition.
7/5/2 Tracing the Shariah ruling on the issue in the different schools
of  Fiqh,  and  exerting  due  endeavors  to  ascertain  if  the  issue
encounters the existence of contradicting proofs, or it is an issue
that has not been specifically dealt with in the Qur`an and the
Sunnah or discussed by the Fuqaha.
7/5/3 Making  use  of  collective  Fatwas,  such  as  the  resolutions  of
the Islamic Fiqh Academy, other Shariah Advisory Boards,
seminars, and conferences.
7/6  The board should issue Fatwa whenever the Institution approaches
it for that purpose, except when it feels that the Institution may use
the Fatwa for committing a impermissible action. In that case, the
board may either refrain from issuing the Fatwa, or make it subject
to certain restrictions.
7/7  Endeavors should be made for disseminating the Fatwas of the In-
stitution  and  exchanging  them  with  other  Institutions  and  related
bodies.
8. Fatwa Controls
8/1  Derivation  of  presumptive  indications  from  the  texts,  or  usage  of
unattested narrations about the Prophet (peace be upon him) should
be avoided. Moreover, all the Sunnah texts used for supporting the
Fatwa should be well-documented.
741741
Shariah Standard No. (29): Stipulations and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework
8/2  Fatwa issuers, while issuing the Fatwa, shall signify keenness to quote
 and opinions of diligent Fuqaha from their accredited sources,
Ijma and opinions of diligent Fuqaha from their accredited sources,
Ijma
as well as concentration on those opinions which have gained more
accreditation in each School of Fiqh, and should resort to available
Fiqh literature on principles of issuing Fatwa.
8/3  When the Fatwa offers the chance for choice between two permissible
actions,  preference  shall  be  given  to  the  easier.  If  choosing  one  of
the  two  permissible  actions  would  result  in  realization  of  a  lawful
interest  while  choosing  the  other  would  leave  the  door  open  for
blight, leaving the door open for blight should be avoided, and efforts
shall be exerted to resolve the repercussions that may subsequently
result.
8/4  Fatwa  issuers  shall  not  always  pursue  Shariah  exemptions  to  make
matters easier for Institutions. A Shariah exemption should be sought
only  when  it  results  from  thorough  examination  of  the  issue  and
appropriate  reasoning.  Moreover,  it  has  to  be  ensured  that  making
use  of  the  Shariah  exemption  does  not  embody  a  related  act  that
the  Fuqaha  unanimously  consider  as  prohibited,  or  lead  to  issuing
different  Fatwas  for  two  identical  incidences.  Misuse  of  Shariah
 (fabrication).

8/5  Fatwa issuers shall not direct Institutions to impermissible tricks for
escaping Shariah restrictions, or violating the objectives of Shariah
legislation.
8/6  Fatwa shall not be issued hastily, declaring (for instance) prohibition
of an act for the mere sense of condemnation that the one feels towards
new habits and traditions, unless such habits and traditions contradict
with  the  rules  and  principles  of  the  Shariah.  Similarly,  declaring
permissibility of an act shall not come for the mere sake of following
rules and traditions.
8/7  It shall be made clear, when necessary, that declaring permissibility
of an act is by no means amount to recommending that act or making
a call for performing it.

9. Text of Fatwa
9/1  The Fatwa shall be clearly stated so that it may not be misunderstood
by the layman, or taken to mean different things to those who have
bad intentions.
9/2  When there are more than one Fiqh opinion on the same issue, the
board shall declare the specific opinion that it subscribes to. If the
issue is controversial the board has to explain the specific bases of its
choice.
9/2  When the Fatwa has more than one aspect all such aspects have to be
clearly indicated.
9/3  In principle, mentioning the proof is not an underlying condition
9/3  In  principle,  mentioning the proof is not  an  underlying  condition
for issuing the Fatwa, and the Institution has no right to impose it as
a condition for accepting it. However, the board has to refer to the
bases of its Fatwa.
9/4  The  Fatwa  statement  shall  be  precise,  concise  and  free  from  any
confusing details and preachy expressions that have nothing to do
with serving the purpose. If, however, the subject requires detailed
statement  for  the  sake  of  public  interest  or  so  as  to  convince  the
regulatory  and  supervisory  bodies,  it  would  be  better  to  add  such
expressions, in order to justify the ruling, indicate the goal behind it,
and warn against falling into blights.
9/5  There is no harm to provide more information than what has been
requested by the seeker of the Fatwa in order to leave no room for
confusion, or to distinct the opinion from other similar opinions, or
to serve a future need of the Fatwa seeker.
10. Fatwa Manuscript (Document)
10/1 In principle, Fatwa can be issued by uttering, signaling or acting,
but for Institutions it should be written to become an evidence
or a document that can be referred to.
10/2 Fatwa shall be started by the Verse of Basmalah
10/2 Fatwa shall be started by the Verse of
 (i.e., In the name of
Basmalah (i.e., In the name of
Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), along with praise to
Allah and blessings on Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
743743
Shariah Standard No. (29): Stipulations and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework
At the end of the Fatwa, the same expressions could be repeated
  (Allah  knows  best)
Allahu  Alam  (Allah  knows  best)
or,  in  stead,  expressions  like  Allahu  Alam
or,  in  stead,  expressions  like
could be introduced to indicate closing up of the Fatwa statement.
10/3  Fatwa shall be clearly handwritten or typed, and each page of it
shall be initialed. It should also carry the date of its issuance and
the official stamp of its issuing source, if such stamp is available.
10/4 Clear linkage between the Fatwa request and the Fatwa statement
should be indicated. Preferably, there shall be a precise summary
of the question.
10/5 When the Fatwa is issued by the concerned board of the Institution,
the content of the Fatwa shall be stated in the formal proceedings
of the board meeting.
11. Retreat from a Mistaken Fatwa
11/1  The board has to retreat from its Fatwa if it is proved to be wrong
on reviewing, or on examination by a higher body. In such case, the
board has to inform the Institution so as to rectify the ruling and its
consequent effects. The Institution on its part has to correct all the
actions that had been based on the wrong Fatwa and refrain from
adopting it any more.
11/2  The board, on its own initiative or on request of the institution, has
the  right  to  review  a  previous  Fatwa  even  if  such  revision  would
lead  to  issuing  a  new  Fatwa  that  contravenes  the  former  one.  In
such case, the Institution has to follow the new Fatwa in the future
and rectify the effects and repercussions of the old one.
12. Morals of Fatwa (Ethics of Fatwa Issuers)
12/1 Being slow and cautious in explaining the Fatwa, and avoiding over-
courage in making Fatwa decisions.
12/2 Avoidance of issuing different Fatwas, on the same subject and the
same issue, according to the source of the Fatwa request.
12/3  Fatwa issuer should avoid issuing Fatwa when he is mentally in-
volved in a personal affair that leaves him no room for offering
correct judgment.
744744
Shariah Standard No. (29): Stipulations and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework
12/4  Keeping the secrets of the Institution and its employees, as well as
the application mechanisms, which have been revealed to the board
in the Fatwa process. Dealing with such secrets should not surpass
the  limits  of  illustrating  the  Fatwa,  to  indulge  into  unnecessary
disclosure  of  information  on  technical  means  and  procedures  of
application.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
The Shariah Board decided in its meeting No. (14) held in Dubai (U.A.E)
on 2123 Rabi I, 1426 A.H., corresponding to 30 April  2 May 2005 A.D., to
issue a Shariah Standard on Controls and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional
Framework.
On 29 Jumada I, 1426 A.H., corresponding to 6 July 2005 A.D., the Shariah
Standards Committee decided to commission a Shariah consultant to prepare
a study on Controls and Ethics of Fatwa in the Institutional Framework.
The study was discussed in a meeting of a joint committee comprising
Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah
on 89 Rabi I, 1427 A.H., corresponding to 67 April 2006 A.D., and the
consultant was advised to incorporate necessary changes, in the light of the
discussions and observations raised in the meeting.
The revised draft of the Standard was submitted to the Shariah Board in
its meeting No. (16) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah on 712 Jumada
I,  1427  A.H.,  corresponding  to  38  June  2006  A.D.  Further  changes  were
introduced in the draft and the board decided to send it to the concerned
experts for review and observations before discussing it in a public hearing.
AAOIFI  then  held,  in  the  Kingdom  of  Bahrain  on  6  Rajab  1427
A.H.,  corresponding  to  31  July  2006  A.D.,  a  public  hearing  which  was
attended  by  more  than  30  participants  representing  central  banks,
institutions,  accounting  firms,  Shariah  scholars,  university  teachers  and
institutions,
accounting  firms,  Shariah  scholars,  university  teachers  and
other interested parties. Several observations were made in the session to

in  the  public  hearing  and  adopted  the  Standard  (unanimously  for  some
clauses and with the majority for others), as indicated in the minutes of the

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  Fatwa is considered as a collective duty that can be discharged of by any
Fatwa is considered as a collective duty that can be discharged of by any
one of those who are able to do it, because it is one of the religious func-
tions  that  serve  public  interest.  Therefore,  what  is  required  is  to  have
someone in the Muslim community who can issue Fatwa, rather than to
have each and every individual of the community able to do so. Fatwa
would  become  the duty  of  a  specific individual  or  a  group  only  if  that
would  become  the  duty  of  a  specific  individual  or  a  group  only  if  that
individual  or  group  is  the  only  one  who  can  issue  it.  If  Fatwa  were  to
become the duty of every member of the society, things would be more
complicated.(2)(2)

It  is  the  duty  of  the  institutions  to  seek  Fatwa  because  otherwise  they
would not be able to meet their commitments to observe the rules of the
Islamic Shariah. Therefore, Institutions should approach the boards for
obtaining Fatwa. Similarly, it is the duty of the board to issue Fatwa to
the Institution due to the relationship that binds the two by virtue of the
decision of the general assembly (equity owners) of the Institution.
  Acceptance of the Fatwa of a Shariah scholar whose knowledge is confined

to only one branch of Fiqh, such as financial transactions in institutions,

Preventing  the  Institution  to  adopt  the  Fatwas  of  other  boards,  except
when  allowed  by  its  own  board  to  do  so,  stems  from  the  need  to  bar
the  way  to  any  tendency  of  fabrication  or  attempt  to  pursue  Shariah
exemptions  without  observing  their  relevant  controls  or  their  context
and circumstances, an act which leads to adoption of irrelevant Fatwas.

Judgment  entails  the  issuance  of  a  verdict  which  is  binding  to  the  two
litigants. In this sense, Fatwa differs from judgment as the latter entails
offering a Shariah ruling without enforcing commitment towards it. Fatwa
also differs from education, because the latter is not restricted to a specific
incident.  Therefore,  Fatwa  is  quite  distinct  from  an  initiation  to  teach
Shariah rulings, or a mere act of seeking knowledge about hypothetical
incidences.

Preface
The purpose of this standard is to indicate the essence of Monetization
and explain the Shariah conditions for its validity, as well as the controls
pertaining to its application in Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/
Institutions).(1)(1)
Institutions).
(1) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
institutions including Islamic Banks.

Shariah Standard No. (30): Monetization (Tawarruq)
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers the different applications of monetization, whether
the beneficiary is the customer or the institution.
Bay Al-Inah
2. Definition of Monetization and Its Distinction from Bay Al-Inah
2. Definition of Monetization and Its Distinction from
  Monetization  refers  to  the  process  of  purchasing  a  commodity  for  a  de-
ferred price determined through Musawamah (Bargaining) or Murabahah
(Mark-up Sale), and selling it to a third party for a spot price so as to obtain
cash.
  Whereas Inah refers to the process of purchasing the commodity for
a deferred price, and selling it for a lower spot price to the same party
from whom the commodity was purchased.
3. Mutawarriq (Monetization Beneficiary)
3/1  The  Monetization  beneficiary  may  be  a  customer  who  purchases
the commodity from the Institution and sells it to a third party to
obtain liquidity. It may also be the Institution itself when it purchases
the commodity from the customer or another Institution and sells
it to a third party to obtain liquidity. The controls for both cases are
shown in items (4) and (5) below.
3/2  The  institution  should  not  perform  Monetization  for  the  benefit
of conventional banks when it discovers that such banks are going
to  use  the  liquidity  for  interest-based  lending  instead  of  Shariah-
compliant operations.
4. Controls on Monetization Transactions
4/1  The requirements of the contract for purchasing the commodity on
deferred payment bases should be fulfilled, for both Musawamah and
Murabahah transactions, with due consideration to Shariah Standard
758758
Shariah Standard No. (30): Monetization (Tawarruq)
No.  (8)  on  Murabahah.  There  shall  also  be  a  real  commodity  that
the seller owns before selling it. If the process is to involve a binding
promise, it shall be from only one party. As regards the commodity
sold, it shall not be gold or silver or any type of currency.
4/2  The commodity sold shall be well identified so as to become distinct
from the other assets of the seller. This may be done by separating
the commodity from the other assets of the seller, or recording the
numbers  of  its  identifying  documents  such  as  storing  certificates.
[see Shariah Standard No. (20) on Sale of Commodities in Organized
Markets, item 4/2/2]
4/3  If the commodity is not made available at the time of signing the
contract,  the  client  shall  be  given  a  full  description  or  a  sample
that indicates the quantity of the commodity and the place of its
storage, so that his act of purchasing the commodity becomes real
rather  than  fictitious.  In  this  sense,  using  local  commodities  for
Monetization is more preferable.
4/4  The commodity shall be actually or constructively received by the
buyer,  and  there  remains  no  further  condition  or  procedure  for
receiving it.
4/5  The  commodity  (object  of  Monetization)  must  be  sold  to  a  party
other than the one from whom it was purchased on deferred payment
basis (third party), so as to avoid Inah which is strictly prohibited.
Moreover,  the  commodity  shall  not  return  back  to  the  seller  by
virtue of prior agreement or collusion between the two parties, or
according to tradition.
4/6  The  contract  for  purchasing  the  commodity  on  deferred  payment
basis, and the contract for selling it for a spot price shall not be linked
together in such a way that the client looses his right to receive the
commodity. Such linking of the two contracts is prohibited whether it
is made through stipulation in the documents, acceptance as a normal
tradition, or incorporation in the procedures.
759759
Shariah Standard No. (30): Monetization (Tawarruq)
4/7  The client shall not delegate the Institution or its agent to sell, on his his
4/7  The client shall not delegate the Institution or its agent to sell, on
behalf, a commodity that he purchased from the same Institution and,
similarly, the Institution shall not accept such delegation. If, however,
the regulations do not permit the client to sell the commodity except
through the same Institution, he may delegate the Institution to do so
after he, actually or constructively, receives the commodity.
4/8  The Institution should not arrange proxy of a third party to sell, on
behalf of the client, the commodity that the client purchased from
the Institution.
4/9  The client shall not sell the commodity except by himself or through
an agent other than the Institution, and shall duly observe the other
stipulations.
4/10  The Institution shall provide the client with the information that he
or his appointed agent may need for selling the commodity.
5. Controls on Monetization When the Institution Is the Beneficiary
5/1  Monetization is not a mode of investment or financing. It has been
permitted when there is a need for it, subject to specific terms and
conditions.  Therefore,  the  Institutions  shall  not  use  Monetization
as  a  means  of  mobilizing  liquidity  for  their  operations,  and  exert
no  effort  for  fund  mobilization  through  other  modes  such  as
Mudarabah, investment agency, Sukuk, investments funds, and the
like. The Institution shall resort to monetization only when it faces
the danger of a liquidity shortage that could interrupt the flow of its
operations and cause losses for its clients.
5/2  The  institutions  shall  avoid  proxy  in  selling  the  Monetization
commodity, even if proxy is to be arranged with a third party. In
other words, Institutions shall use their own bodies for selling the
monetization commodity, though using brokers for this purpose is
permissible.

 Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  Differentiation between Monetization and Inah with regard to permis-
Differentiation between Monetization and Inah with regard to permis-
sibility and prohibition stems from the fact that, contrary to the former,
the latter is a trick for practicing Riba (usury). Inah takes place between
two parties who are in fact a borrower and a lender. The lender sells
the commodity to the borrower for a deferred price and buys it back
from him for a less price payable on spot. The majority of the Fuqaha
subscribe to prohibition of Inah and permissibility of monetization, ex-
cept Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim who consider monetization as
prohibited or worthy of aversion.
  Permissibility of constructive receipt of the commodity has already been
Permissibility of constructive receipt of the commodity has already been
catered for in the Shariah Standard No. (18) on Possession (Qabd) and
the Shariah Standard No. (1) on Trading in Currencies.
   Permissibility of monetization transactions that observe the Shariah controls
Permissibility of monetization transactions that observe the Shariah controls
indicated  in  this  Standard  can  be  traced  in  the  texts  of  the  Qur`an  and
the  Sunnah  that  permit  sale  transactions.  It  has  also  been  confirmed  by
the Sunnah that permit sale transactions. It has also been confirmed by
two resolutions issued by the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World
League,(2)(2) and the Standing Committee of the Supreme Board of Shariah
League,
 and the Standing Committee of the Supreme Board of Shariah
Scholars of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Fatwa No. 19297), as well as the
Fatwas of several Shariah Supervisory Boards. Therefore, monetization is
it, as it is usual-
an exit for avoiding Riba rather than a trick for performing it, as it is usual-

   Prohibition of joining together the contract for purchasing the commodity
Prohibition of joining together the contract for purchasing the commodity
and  the  contract  for  selling  it  is  justified  by  the  fact  that  joining  them
together
would impose a commitment on the client to sell the commodity
together would impose a commitment on the client to sell the commodity
right  away.  Hence,  such  immediate  transfer  of  the  ownership  of  the
commodity may not enable the client to receive it. This is again the same
reason for prohibition of agency-related commitments.
  Permissibly  of  resorting  to  agency  of  the  Institution  when  the  client,  by
Permissibly  of  resorting  to  agency  of  the  Institution  when  the  client,  by
virtue of law, cannot sell the commodity directly, is meant to safeguard the
deal from being nullified by the law.
  The  ruling  that  the  Institution  shall  provide  detailed  information  about
The  ruling  that  the  Institution  shall  provide  detailed  information  about
the commodity to the client aims at preventing fictitious transactions and
helping the client to obtain liquidity. Such requirement holds true whether
the  commodity  in  question  is  a  commodity,  a  car,  shares  of  a  company,
international  goods,  or  local  goods.  The  latter  are  more  suitable  for
monetization due to the easiness of ensuring their existence, and the chance
available to the client to actually hold them if he so desires.
  The ruling that the Institution shall provide the client with a full description
The ruling that the Institution shall provide the client with a full description
or a sample of the commodity is to ensure that the latters act of purchasing
the commodity is actual rather than fictitious.

for expanding monetization to the extent that jeopardizes the extensive
use  of  the  original  modes  of  investment  and  financing.  Therefore,
Institutions shall not use monetization except in the limited scope defined
in this Standard. They shall also restrict the use of monetization to the
cases of clients whose transactions cannot be disposed of through other
modes  of  financing  and  investment  such  as  Musharakah,  Mudarabah,
Ijarah, Istisnaa and the like. Monetization may also be used as a means
for helping the clients to dispose of their previous interest-based debts,
after ensuring that they have developed genuine intention not to deal in
usurious transactions any more.

and impacts and emphasizing controls that need to be applied when Gharar
is to the extent which nullifies transactions.

Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers the impact of excessive, medium and minor Gharar
on transactions performed by Islamic financial institutions (Institution/
Institutions).(1)(1)  In  this  respect  the  standard  will  set  out  the  Shariah
Institutions).

2. Definition and Types of Gharar
2/1  Gharar is a state of uncertainty that exists when the process of con-
cluding a transaction involves an unknown aspect. In other words,
Gharar refers to the status of results that may or may not materialize.
2/2  Degree-wise, Gharar can be excessive, medium or minor. As regards
its effect on the transaction, Gharar can be to the extent which nullifies
the contract or it may not be so.
3. Shariah Status of Gharar
It is impermissible in Shariah to conclude a contract or stipulate a condition
that involves a degree of Gharar which could jeopardize the fulfillment of
the contracts stipulations. The degree of Gharar for this purpose is judged
as per item (4) below.
4. Controls on Gharar Which Violates Transactions
  Gharar violates the transaction when it satisfies the following four condi-
tions:
 The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
(1)(1) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
institutions including Islamic Banks.
772772
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
a)  If it is involved in an exchange-based contract or any contract of that
nature.
b)  If it is excessive in degree.
c)  If it relates to the primary subject matter of the contract.
d) If it is not justified by a Shariah-recognizable necessity.
4/1 First Condition: When Gharar is in an exchange-based contract
or a similar contract:
This  includes,  for  instance,  sale,  lease  and  partnership  contracts,
whereas Gharar does not affect donation contracts such as gift and
will contracts.
In an exchange-based contract Gharar can be either in the form or
subject matter of the contract.
4/2  Second Condition: When Gharar is excessive
4/2/1  Gharar is excessive when it becomes a dominating and distinctive
aspect  of  the  contract,  and  is  capable  of  leading  to  dispute.
However,  assessment  of  Gharar  for  such  purpose  could  differ
according to place and time, and has to be determined in the light
of normal practice (Urf). Examples of excessive Gharar include
selling of fruits before production, signing a lease contract for
an  unspecified  period,  and  sale  of  a  Salam  commodity  that  is
not usually available on date of delivery. Gharar in any of these
forms sets the contract null and void.
4/2/2 Minor  Gharar  is  the  degree  of  Gharar  that  a  contract  could
hardly  avoid,  and  is  not  sufficient  to  generate  dispute.  This
includes transactions like sale of a house to a buyer who has
not  seen  its  foundation,  or  leasing  the  house  for  one  month
while months differ in length. Such type of Gharar does not
affect the contract.
4/2/3  Medium Gharar falls between excessive and minor and its ex-
amples are: sale of underground commodities or commodities
that  cannot  be  known  unless  broken,  or  leasing  of  fruit  trees.
773773
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
Medium Gharar can also exist in contracts like Jualah (payment
of  a  specific  reward  for  a  task  if  accomplished),  guardianship,
companies  and  fixed-term  Mudarabah.  Medium  Gharar  does
not affect the contract.
4/3  Third Condition: When Gharar relates to the primary object of
the contract
If Gharar relates to the primary subject matter of the transaction, it
sets the contract null and void, as when unripe fruits are sold (apart
from the trees and without a stipulation for awaiting harvesting). If,
instead, Gharar is in a corollary (
) of the primary subject matter,
instead, Gharar is in a corollary (TabiTabi) of the primary subject matter,
it  has  no  effect  on  the  contract.  The  example  here  is  selling  the
unripe fruits along with the trees, or selling the nonexistent part of
the plants along with the part that already exists. A further example
of Gharar in a corollary is a fetus sold along with the pregnant sheep,
or milk in the udder of a sold sheep.
4/4  Fourth Condition: When no Shariah-recognizable need has neces-
sitated Gharar in the contract
  Need in this context (which could be public or private) refers to the
situation when refraining from commitment of impermissible Gharar
leads to severe hardship, though may not amount to mortality. Need
should also be inevitable; i e, there should be no permissible way of
accomplishing  the  task,  except  through  the  contract  that  involves
excessive Gharar. Commercial insurance, in the absence of Takaful
(solidarity insurance) can be cited here as a fitting example.

Gharar in this type of contracts could be in the form, object or terms of
the contract.
5/1  Excessive Gharar in the form of the contract
  Gharar is said to be in the form of the contract when it relates to offer
and acceptance rather than to the object of the contract. Practical types
of such Gharar comprise the following:
774774
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
Bayatayn Fi Bayah)
5/1/1  Combining two sales in one sale (Bayatayn Fi Bayah
5/1/1  Combining two sales in one sale (
Combining two sales in one sale nullifies the contract, and the
examples of that is selling a good for one thousand pounds in
cash or two thousands on deferred payment, without concluding
any of the two deals.
5/1/2 Sales in which the deal is finalized subject to random selection
of the sold object
Sales  become  void  when  the  sold  item  is  randomly  selected.
One example of such type of sale is
 (sale by stone
Bay al-Hasah (sale by stone
One example of such type of sale is Bay al-Hasah
throwing), in which the seller throws a stone and the buyer has
to accept the item on which the stone falls. Another example is
Bay al-Munabadhah
 (throwing of the sold commodity), where
Bay al-Munabadhah (throwing of the sold commodity), where
the seller throws to the buyer one of the commodities he wants
to sell. Such sale could also be conducted by using a programmed
machine to determine the sold good irrespective of the choices of
the seller and the buyer.
5/2  Gharar in the object of the contract
5/2/1 Gharar in sold or leased objects and the like
5/2/1/1  Gharar which results from ignorance of the essence of
the sold commodity nullifies the contract. This type of
Gharar takes place when, for instance, a sale contract is
concluded without indicating what the sold commodity
is.  Ignorance  of  the  essence  of  the  sold  commodity
would consequently result in ignorance of the type and
characteristics of that commodity.
5/2/1/2  Gharar which stems from ignorance of the type of the
sold commodity nullifies the contract, as when a car is
sold without specifying its type, or when an amount of
currency is sold (through a currency exchange contract)
without indicating the type of that currency or having
a generally accepted tradition for its determination.
775775
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
5/2/1/3  Gharar  which  results  from  lack  of  knowledge  of  the
sold commodity in particular (non-specification of the
commodity) nullifies the contract. The example of this
is sale of a non-specified car from a number of cars in
a car showroom, or sale of a piece of land in a residential
area without the option of specification.
5/2/1/4  Gharar due to ignorance of the specific characteristics
of the sold commodity (for commodities that usually
differ  in  nature)  nullifies  the  contract.  This  happens
when  a  nonexistent  commodity  is  sold  without  de-
scribing it.
5/2/1/5  Gharar  due  to  ignorance  of  the  amount  of  the  sold
commodity, such as
 (sale of an unknown
Bay al-Juzaf (sale of an unknown
commodity, such as Bay al-Juzaf
quantity),  nullifies  the  contract,  except  when  there
exist the conditions that make Gharar forgivable. Such
conditions include: viewing the sold commodity at the
time of sale, or when estimation is possible in the case
of the commodity in question, or if what really matters
for that specific commodity is the quantity as a whole
rather than the individual components. In such cases,
Gharar does not nullify the contract.
5/2/2 Gharar in the price or rent of the contracts object
Gharar  could  arise  when,  for  instance,  a  commodity  is  sold
without mentioning the price, or when the price is left to be
determined  by  one  of  the  two  parties  of  the  contract,  or  by
a third party. Another example here is the case of somebody
purchasing a commodity for an amount of money in a bundle
or in his pocket. A third example is purchasing the commodity
by using a currency which the buyer ignores its issuer and has
no indication that could help him to know it. In all these cases,
Gharar nullifies the sale contract.
However,  there  are  some  cases  where  Gharar  in  the  price  is
permitted, as - for instance - when the sale contract is concluded
776776
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
at the market price on the day of purchase, or at the price to be
set by the market on the day of purchase, or at the price people
usually sell at.
Sale  with  forgivable  Gharar  in  price  could  also  include
, in which the
Bay al- Istjrar, in which the
purchasing commodities through Bay al- Istjrar
purchasing commodities through
buyer obtains the goods regularly from the seller for a price
to  be  determined  subject  to  the  price  that  people  normally
sell at, or subject to an index, and even after consumption of
the goods in question.
A similar sale contract is that which comprises selling, at unit
price, of a quantity of the commodity which the buyer can see,
yet does not know its exact amount or total value. That is to say,
one could sell a quantity of grains at the price per kilogram, or
he could rent a car at a rent per mile, so that the payable amount
of rent is determined after reaching the target destination.
Furthermore, such sales may include concluding a lease contract
at the rent normally paid for similar property, or for a variable
rent to be indicated by a specialized index.
In all these preceding cases, the contract does not become null
and void.
5/3  Gharar relating to ignorance of the contracts period
5/3/1 The contract becomes null and void when its duration is not
stipulated. If, however, Gharar is removed by knowledge of the
contracts  duration,  or  abandonment  of  the  duration,  at  the
time of contracting, the contract becomes valid.
5/3/2 Gharar  can  be  forgiven  in  postponement  of  the  price  until
known seasons such as season of harvesting. In this case, the
two  parties  should  observe  the  normal  date  of  the  season
rather than the event of harvesting.
5/4  Gharar pertaining to failure in delivery
  Gharar which relates to failure in delivery nullifies the contract. Ex-
 it is
amples of such Gharar include selling of fish in the water, unless it is
amples of such Gharar include selling of fish in the water, unless
777777
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
found in a confined place and does not require fishing. Such type of
Gharar can also be seen in the sale (without option) of a commodity
to be imported from abroad, and one is not sure whether a license
for its importation would be obtained or not.
5/5  Gharar relating to sale of non-owned commodities
  Gharar relating to sale of a non-owned commodity nullifies the sale
contract. It refers to the case when the seller does not (personally)
have  the  commodity  at  the  time  of  signing  the  contract,  and  has
to purchase it from the market. Salam and Istisnaa are exceptional
cases here (subject to their respective conditions).
5/6  Gharar that results from sale of non-held commodities
  A person shall not sell a commodity (whether it is a real estate or
movable property) that he does not guarantee through actual or con-
structive holding. In the absence of actual or constructive holding, it
will not be possible to determine the party that possesses (and hence
guarantee) the sold object. Therefore, selling a commodity that one
does not own nullifies the sale contract.
  Actual holding in this context refers to receiving the good in hand,
or  receipt  of  the  exact  quantity  in  case  of  commodities  measured
in terms of volume or so. If the deal in question pertains to a Juzaf
commodity (a commodity of an unknown quantity) holding would
require shifting the commodity to another location. Holding in all
cases, other than the preceding ones, shall be judged as per normal
practice.
  As regards constructive holding, it indicates the act of releasing the
commodity and facilitating the process of its holding.
5/7  Gharar resulting from sale of nonexistent commodities
It is impermissible to sell a commodity that neither existents at present,
nor does its existence in the future is ensured. Muawamah sale (sale
of fruits to be delivered over several years) is a good example of such
transactions.
778778
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
5/8 Gharar which results from lack of viewing the sold commodity
Bay al-Ayn al-Gha`ibah)
(Bay al-Ayn al-Gha`ibah
5/8/1 It is impermissible to sell a commodity without enabling the
buyer to view it or obtain its full description. Nevertheless,
a commodity can be sold on the basis of mere description,
whether description is to be made by the seller or someone
else.  Description  should  include  all  those  characteristics
which could affect the price. The buyer should then conclude
the deal if the commodity is exactly as described, otherwise
he is free to conclude the deal or not.
5/8/2 It is permissible to sell an asset that the buyer has seen sometime
before the time of signing the contract, provided that the asset
has undergone no change since that time.
5/8/3 A sale can be concluded on the basis of a model that indicates
the characteristics of the sold commodity.
6. Impact of Gharar on Documentation Contracts
6/1  Impact of Gharar on Rahn (Mortgage) contracts
  Rahn (Mortgage) can permissibly involve a degree of Gharar that
is not allowed in sale. For instance, a lost car or a farm that has not
yet reached the stage of giving yield can be the object of a mortgage
contract. Nonetheless, such property cannot be sold for settlement
of the debt, unless the lost car is found or the farm has reached the
stage of giving yield. [see Shariah Standard No. (5) on Guarantees]
6/2  Impact of Gharar on suretyship (Kafalah) contracts
Suretyship
(Kafalah)  can  also  involve  a  degree  of  Gharar  that  is  not

condition does not contradict with the stipulations of the contract); or
it can be for an unknown period; or it may relate to a future obligation.
[see Shariah Standard No. (5) on Guarantees]
6/3  Impact of Gharar on agency (Wakalah) contracts
  Agency (Wakalah) is permissible with Gharar, if there are indications
or  traditions  that  can  be  used  for  specifying  its  subject  matter.  For
779779
Shariah Standard No. (31): Controls on Gharar in Financial Transactions
instance,  agency  can  be  conditional,  or  its  subject  matter  can  be
identified through some of its forms. This shall, however, hold true
when agency is free of charge, otherwise it shall be treated like Ijarah
(hiring) and, thus, affected by Gharar. It is also permissible to make
general agency contracts. [see Shariah Standard No. (23) on Agency
and the Act of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)]
7. Impact of Gharar Which Stems from the Conditions of the Contract
  The condition which results in Gharar in the form or subject matter of
the contract:
  A contract becomes null and void if it contains a condition that causes
Gharar  in  its  form,  as  when  it  contains  an  option  without  time  limit.
A  contract  can  also  become  null  and  void  for  involving  Gharar  in  its
subject matter, as in the case of

sale  of  a  property,  while  retaining  the  remaining  part  as  an  exception
(e.g., selling a multistory building with the exception of one floor without
specifying  it).  Such  sale  is  permissible  only  if  the  retained  part  of  the
property is specified.

Gharar is divided into excessive, medium and minor, because there is
a degree of Gharar which contracts could hardly avoid, whereas there

Assessing excessive Gharar in terms of the four conditions mentioned in
  Assessing excessive Gharar in terms of the four conditions mentioned in
this Standard is justified as follows:
1. If Gharar is in an exchange-based contract: Involvement of Gharar in
exchange-based  contracts  would  lead  to  unlawful  acquisition  of  the
wealth of other people, whereas it is not so in donation contracts. No
dispute would arise in the case of donation contracts, since the recipient
of the donation would incur no loss.
2. If Gharar is excessive: This is due to the consensus of the Shariah scholars
on the impact of excessive Gharar on contracts. They have derived this
conclusion from cases in which, due to involvement of excessive Gharar,
contracts have been nullified by Hadiths (Prophetic traditions).

thus, may lead to dispute. Jahalah here cannot be resolved by offering the
buyer the option of viewing for instance.

buyer). If, instead, the seller is to get the price, while the buyer is unable to
get the sold object, this will violate the very objective of the contract.

Definitions
Ghurur and Taghrir (Deception)
The  difference  between  Gharar,  and  (Ghurur  or  Taghrir)  is  that  the
latter results from a statement, or an act, or a position which a person re-
sort to for the sake of deceiving others, whereas Gharar does not involve
any deception.
Jahalah (Ignorance)
The difference between Gharar and Jahalah is that Jahalah refers to lack
of knowledge about the details of something, in spite of knowledge about
its occurrence. In this sense, Gharar is more comprehensive than Jahalah.
Therefore, all things that are unknown involve Gharar, whereas not all things
that involve Gharar are unknown.
Qimar (Gambling), Murahanah (Betting) and Gharar
Gharar is similar to Qimar and Murahanah in that it entails a result which
could be accomplished or not. However, Gharar does not resemble Qimar
and Murahanah in constituting a means that each party uses for acquiring
money from the other party. Therefore, Qimar is more specific than Gharar,
because not all Gharar is Qimar.
Definition of the Mudaf (Postponed)
Idafah (postponement), refers to delay of the contracts effectiveness to
a specific time in the future, and hence Idafah does not involve uncertainty
like Gharar.

  This standard covers arbitration as practiced in financial transactions and
other  activities  and  relationships  which  take  place  among  institutions,
other  activities  and  relationships  which  take  place  among institutions,
or between Institutions and their clients or employees or other parties;
whether inside or outside the host country of the institution.
2. Definition of Arbitration
2/1  Arbitration is an agreement between two parties or more to designate
an  external  party  for  resolving  a  dispute  between  them  through
of a binding verdict.
issuance of a binding verdict.

2/2  Arbitration in this standard refers to (Islamic Arbitration) which
observes the rules and conditions of Shariah.
3. Forms of Resorting to Arbitration and Arbitration Parties
3/1  Arbitration  can  be  sought  through  agreement  of  the  two  parties  at
the time of dispute, or in fulfillment of a previous agreement between
them to seek arbitration instead of resorting to law. Arbitration can
also be legally imposed on the two parties.
3/2  Seeking Islamic arbitration should be stipulated in the agreements in
which the two parties cannot be forced to resort to laws that contradict
with Shariah.
3/3  Arbitration parties are the two (or more) conflicting parties who seek
arbitration.
4. Permissibility of Arbitration
  Arbitration is permissible whether it is sought by two natural or legal
persons, or by a natural person and a legal person.
794794
Shariah Standard No. (32): Arbitration
5. Shariah Status of Arbitration
5/1  Arbitration is binding in the following cases:
a)  When it is stipulated as a condition in the contract
b)  When the two parties agree on seeking arbitration on dispute, and
pledge to observe its verdicts.
5/2  Arbitration  is  not  binding  for  an  arbitrator  who  is  not  entitled
to  remuneration.  Such  an  arbitrator  can  terminate  himself  after
accepting the task. If the arbitrator is paid for his job, arbitration
accepting  the  task.  If  the  arbitrator  is  paid  for  his  job,  arbitration
becomes  binding  for  him.  In  this  latter  case,  if  the  arbitrator
terminates  himself  after  accepting  the  task,  he  should  bear  any
actual harm that may result from his act. [see Shariah Standard No.
(34) on Hiring of Persons]
6. Basic Elements of Arbitration
6/1  The basic element of arbitration is its form, which refers to the process
of exchange of offer and acceptance between the two parties seeking
arbitration, and the arbitrator.
6/2  Valid arbitration has to fulfill the following requirements:
6/2/1  Existence of dispute between two parties or more, around a per-
missible right.
6/2/2 Agreement between the two parties on arbitration, and their
mutual consent on accepting the verdicts of the arbitrator.
6/2/3 Acceptance of the arbitrator to do the arbitration task.
7. Scope of Arbitration (What Should Be Resolved Through Arbitration
in Shariah)
7/1  Arbitration is permissible in whatever a party is entitled to relinquish
his right in.
7/2  Arbitration is impermissible in the following cases:
7/2/1 What constitutes a right of Allah, Glory be to Him, such as
Hudud (Shariah penalties).
795795
Shariah Standard No. (32): Arbitration
7/2/2 Cases that entail proving or disproving of a verdict that con-
cerns a third party.
7/3  When the arbitrator issues a verdict on an issue that should not be
resolved through arbitration; his verdict is null and void.
8. Characteristics and Appointment of the Arbitrator
8/1  An Arbitrator shall have the full eligibility for performing his task.
8/2  In principle, an arbitrator shall be a Muslim. However, a non-Muslim
arbitrator could be appointed when acute need so requires, in order
to  arrive  at  a  Shariah-accepted  verdict  (in  this  regard,  item  11/1
below shall be observed).
8/3  It is permissible to appoint one arbitrator or more, and  preferably 
the number of arbitrators is to be odd, otherwise, the two parties (the
seekers of arbitration) may appoint a chairman for the arbitration
panel,  whose  vote  shall  be  the  casting  vote  when  other  votes  are
equal.
8/4  Each  of  the  dispute  parties  may  appoint  one  arbitrator,  and  the  ap-
pointed arbitrators may appoint a final arbitrator if they are permit-
to do so by the disputing parties.
ted to do so by the disputing parties.

8/5  When  any  of  the  two  parties  refrains  from  appointing  an  arbitrator
from  his  own  side  as  per  the  contract,  the  other  party  has  the  right
to resort to the judiciary for appointing an arbitrator to represent the
refraining party, provided that the arbitration condition in the contract
does not specify another way for appointing such arbitrator.
8/6  The arbitrator has no right to appoint an alternate arbitrator to replace
him, without the permission of the party that appointed him, because
he  has  been  accepted  as  an  arbitrator  in  person.  However,  the  arbi-
trator could have this right if arbitration is assigned to an Institution
or an arbitration committee whose members are appointed with due
consideration for its declared conditions of selection.
8/7  An agent or a Mudarib does not have the right of accepting arbitration,
except with the consent of the principal for the agent and the owners of

the capital for the Mudarib, or on the basis of a clause in the Mudarabah
conditions such as conditions in investment accounts. No one should
become part of the arbitration on behalf of an institution that has
a legal personality except its official representative.
9. Arbitration Document
9/1  The  arbitration  document  originates  from  agreement  of  the  two
parties of the dispute on arbitration, and acceptance of the arbitrator
to perform the task, and is called (the arbitration contract) or (the
arbitration agreement).
9/2  The  arbitration  document  should  include  the  names  of  the  two
parties of the dispute, the name of the arbitrator, the overall subject
of dispute, the date specified for arbitration and the fees payable to
the arbitrator if any.
9/3  The  arbitration  condition  is  the  commitment  of  the  two  parties
of the arbitration contract or agreement to resolve their disputes
through arbitration. If such condition is stipulated in any agreement
or contract, there will remain no need for agreement on arbitration
at the time of dispute.
9/4  The arbitrator should apply the rulings of Shariah. If he is obliged to
apply a certain law, he should still not violate the rulings of Shariah.
9/5  The  two  parties  of  the  arbitration  have  the  right  to  impose  any
permissible limitation on the arbitration so as to serve a permissible
purpose  of  their  own.  Permissible  limitations  may  include,  for
instance:  issuance  of  the  verdict  within  a  specific  time  limit  or
in view of a certain School of Fiqh or a certain law that does not
contradict  the  Shariah;  or  consultation  with  exerts  specified  in
name or by description. In the latter case, however, the arbitrator is
not bound to accept the viewpoints of the experts.
9/6  When the period specified for arbitration expires without issuance of
the verdict, the arbitrator becomes terminated, unless the two parties
agree  on  extending  the  period.  The  arbitration  period  starts  at  the
797797
Shariah Standard No. (32): Arbitration
time when the arbitration document has been signed by all the parties
seeking arbitration, and ends up at the time when the arbitration
verdict has been signed by all these parties.
9/7  It is permissible to conclude a verbal arbitration contract, however,
Institutions should document the arbitration verdict in writing.
9/8  Acceptance of arbitration does not require attestation in the arbitration
document, though such attestation is preferable.
10. Methods of Judgment, Procedures and Proving in Arbitration
10/1  The arbitrator is free to use any legally accepted method of judgment,
such as confession, evidence (attestation), oath taking, or
refraining
such as confession, evidence (attestation), oath taking, or refraining
from  oath  (Nukul),  while  he  should  not  make  judgment  on
the  basis  of  his  own  opinion.  When  the  arbitrator  rejects  an
attestation, his rejection should not constitute a reason for denial
of that attestation in other arbitrations or in the judiciary, unless
the same attestation is also rejected by the judiciary.
10/2  The arbitrator has the right to request all the documents and proofs
relating  to  the  dispute,  or  copies  of  such  documents  verified  in
comparison to originals. He has to show such documents to the two
parties so as to seek their opinions on them. The arbitrator has also
the right to request verbal or written statements from the two parties
of the dispute or the witnesses, and to consult experts if needed.
10/3  The Arbitrator is neither required to follow the procedural rules
of the judiciary, nor is he obliged to observe laws, unless such laws
are part of public order.
 10/4 The arbitrator is not supposed to stick to the legally stipulated
rules of evidence. Instead, he has the right to make use of any
other  evidence,  provided  that  the  acceptance  of  that  evidence
does not contradict with the rules of Shariah.
10/5  The arbitration verdict is issued by consensus or majority and in
the  case  of  equal  votes  the  party  which  includes  the  chairman  is
considered to have the casting vote, unless some other arrangements
are  proposed  in  the  arbitration  document  or  the  rules  of  the
arbitrating entity.
798798
Shariah Standard No. (32): Arbitration
11. Issuance of the Arbitration Verdict
11/1  A valid arbitration decision should lead to a verdict that conform
to the rules of Shariah.
11/2  The final arbitration decision should resolve all points of dispute
and lead to fair specification of the rights of the arbitration parties.
When  arbitration  ends  up  with  partial  resolution  of  the  points
of dispute, arbitration is incomplete since it has not enabled the
disputing parties to avoid resorting to legal suing. In this case, the
disputing parties have the right to demand a further decision from
the arbitrator so as to resolve the remaining points of dispute.
11/3  Arbitration should not go beyond the subject matter of dispute,
because tackling of any further issue does not fall within the man-
date of the arbitrator, unless the two parties of the dispute agree to
add it.
11/4 The arbitrator has the right, subject to his own discretion or on
request of the disputing parties, to issue a commentary on the
arbitration  decision,  or  introduce  corrections  for  any  material
mistakes that might be involved therein.
11/5  The arbitrator can issue his decision in a number of preparatory or
partial decisions, or identify the responsibility without estimating
indemnification.
11/6  It  is  preferable  that  the  Shariah  or  basis  of  the  arbitration  de-
cision  be  mentioned  (reasoning),  yet  this  does  not  constitute
a condition for valid arbitration, unless the law so requires.
11/7  In  principle  the  arbitration  decision  is  to  be  issued  in  a  session
attended by the arbitrators if they are many (or most of them, after
invitation). It can also be issued by circulation among members
after being prepared by the final arbitrator, or the chairman of the
arbitration  panel,  or  any  other  authorized  member.  In  the  case
of issuance by circulation, consensus among members should be
reached.
799799
Shariah Standard No. (32): Arbitration
11/8  The arbitration decision is to be issued under the signature of all
members of the arbitration panel (when they are many) including
those  who  raise  objections  against  it,  and  objecting  members
should be allowed to state their objections on the document. The
arbitration  decision  may  also  be  issued  under  the  signature  of
most of the members, after indicating the reasons that made some
members refrain from signing. Nevertheless, the decision has to
be issued at the knowledge of all members as per the minutes of
the session convened for that purpose.
11/9  The arbitration decision includes: the text of the verdict; names,
identities and addresses of the two parties of the dispute; reference
to the date and number of the arbitration document; summary of
the subject matter of dispute; claims of the two parties of the dispute
and  the  supporting documents; names of  witnesses  and experts
and  the  supporting  documents; names of  witnesses  and  experts
whose help was sought if any; names of arbitrators, date and place
of issuing the verdict; signatures of arbitrators; signatures of the
parties of dispute if possible; and reasons of the decision reached
unless the arbitration document comprises exemption from such
reasoning and there is no legal condition to that effect.
11/10  The arbitration decision should not necessarily be issued in the
presence of the two parties of the dispute, although it is better to
be so for shortening the procedure of communicating it to them.
11/11 It would be better to include in the conclusion of the arbitration
decision a request or a recommendation to the judiciary or the
concerned legal authorities to use every permissible means for its
implementation.
11/12 The arbitration decision should not necessarily meet the consent
of  the  two  parties  of  the  dispute.  It  should  spontaneously  be
binding to them, unless it is revoked for being counter to the rules
of Shariah or public order.
11/12 The arbitration decision can be issued on the basis of reconciliation
as prescribed by Shariah or on the basis of consensual agreement.

Shariah Standard No. (32): Arbitration
12. Communication and Validity of the Arbitration Decision
12/1  The arbitration decision shall be communicated to the two parties
of  the  dispute  through  the  normal  procedures,  unless  a  specific
way of communication is identified in the arbitration document
or by any other legal authority.
12/2  The validity of the arbitration decision does not require attestation
of witnesses on communication of the decision to the two parties
of the dispute or the consent of these parties to it, although such
attestation is recommendable for avoiding conflict.
12/3  The validity of the arbitration decision does not require its official
registration or submission to the concerned court, yet this has to
be done if it is required for legitimizing the implementation of the
decision.  In  that  case,  the  date  specified  for  finalization  of  such
procedure should be observed.
12/4  If the arbitration decision is written in more than one language,
the language to be adopted in case of dispute should be specified.
12/5  A  signed  copy  of  the  arbitration  decision  shall  be  handed  over
to  each  of  the  two  parties  of  the  dispute,  while  each  one  of  the
arbitrators (if many) shall retain a signed copy as well.
13. Implementation of the Verdict (the Form of Implementation), or Its
Revocation
13/1  In principle, the two parties of the dispute should implement the
arbitration verdict willingly. In case one party refrains from doing
so, the other party has the right to present the verdict to judiciary
for execution. Therefore, arbitration should not be resorted to if
its verdict cannot be implemented.
13/2  For  legitimizing  the  execution  of  the  arbitration  verdict,  it  is
permissible to approach courts that do not observe the rules of
Shariah.
13/3 The arbitrator does not have the right to retreat from his verdict,
unless when he declares that he has committed a mistake in it.
801801
Shariah Standard No. (32): Arbitration
However,  in  case  of  committing  a  mistake,  the  arbitrator  can
cancel or amend his verdict in view of the rules of the Islamic
Shariah and in the way that would ensure justice.
14. Arbitration Expenses and the Arbitrators Fees
14/1  It  is  permissible  for  the  arbitrator,  if  he  is  not  a  volunteer  or
a government employee designated for doing arbitration, to receive
fees for the task. The amount or percentage of such fees should be
indicated in the conditions of arbitration in case of Institutional
arbitration, or agreed upon in the arbitration document.
14/2  When the arbitration process leads to incurring of any expenses, such
as transportation expenses for the arbitrator, witnesses and experts,
or typing expenses, or fees payable to the arbitrator, the arbitration
decision must specify the party that should bear them. It should be
noted here that the expenses pertaining to the application of any of
the disputing parties should be borne by that party alone, whereas
common expenses are to be shared by the dispute parties, unless it is
proved that one party has been deliberately intending to cause harm
to the other through such expenses. In this latter case, the party that
has  been  intending  to  cause  harm  should  bear  such  expenses.  All
these preceding points hold true in the absence of a prior agreement
which assigns the payment of the expenses to a specific party or to
the condemned party.

In principle, selection of arbitrators should be subject to the same Shariah
conditions for selection of judges including non-partiality. In case of neces-
sity, some of these conditions could be dropped such as the condition that
the arbitrator should be a Muslim. Nevertheless, a non-Muslim arbitrator
should not issue a verdict that contradicts with Shariah.

Appendix (C)
Definitions
Sulh (Reconciliation)
It refers to a request of relinquishment of what the arbitrators consider to
be the right of one of the two parties of the dispute. Such request shall not be
made to a party who is an agent, unless he is delegated to do reconciliation.
Preferably, the issuance of a reconciliation decision is to be based on a clear
clause in the arbitration document indicating that arbitrators have the right
to pursue reconciliation.
Consensual Settlement
It refers to the case when the two parties of the dispute agree, outside the
arbitration task, on a settlement which they both accept, and request the
arbitrators to issue a decision based on that settlement. The arbitrators in
this case shall concur to the request of the two parties, unless the proposed
settlement is impermissible, or contrary to public order.
Arbitration Document
It is a document signed by the two parties to pursue arbitration on a dis-
pute which has arisen between them.
Arbitration Agreement
It is a prior condition or a contract stipulating resort to arbitration when
dispute arises.
Material Mistakes
It refers to unintentional mistakes in names or numbers, when proofs or
documents indicate the aspects which need correction.
Institutional Arbitration
It is the selection of an Institution that comprises competent arbitrators to
resolve the dispute. In this case, there is no need for designating the arbitrator
in name.

Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  presents  the  definition  of  Waqf  and  discusses  its  types,
Shariah rulings, basic elements, and the conditions that pertain to each
of these elements. It also covers the conditions required in the Waqf and
the  Waqif  (donor),  and  illustrates  the  appropriate  methods  for  Waqf
utilization, investment, supervision and management. Furthermore, the
standard covers the crucial role that Islamic financial Institutions could
play in the development of Waqf, and the appropriate methods of Waqf
investment.
  This standard, however, does not cover other philanthropic Institutions
such  as  Irsad  (allocation  of  public  property  for  public  utilities)  and
financial trusts which resemble Waqf in some aspects.
2. Definition, Shariah Rulings, Rationale of Permissibility and Types of
WaqfWaqf
2/1  Definition of Waqf
In Arabic language the word Waqf or Habs means preventing some-
ing
thing from movement. In Shariah terminology, Waqf refers to making
thing from movement. In Shariah terminology, Waqf refers to mak
a property invulnerable to any disposition that leads to transfer of
ownership, and donating the usufruct of that property to beneficia-
ries.
2/2  Shariah status of Waqf
  Waqf  is  permissible  in  Shariah,  as  has  been  emphasized  by  the
Sunnah (Prophetic traditions) and Ijma (
). Waqf
consensus of Fuqaha). Waqf
Sunnah (Prophetic traditions) and Ijma (consensus of Fuqaha
is also a binding commitment, and, therefore, declaring a property as
Waqf  would  spontaneously  deprive  its  donating  owner  the  right  of
ownership.
814814
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
2/3  Permissible types of Waqf
  There  are  several  types  Waqf  of  which  most  important  is  the
), the family Waqf (al-Waqf al-
al-Waqf al-
)  and  self-dedicated
al-Waqf  al-Mushtarak)  and  self-dedicated
),  the  joint  Waqf  (al-Waqf  al-Mushtarak
al-Waqf al-Khayri), the family Waqf (
charitable Waqf (
charitable Waqf (al-Waqf al-Khayri
AhliAhli),  the  joint  Waqf  (
Waqf (Waqf (al-Waqf Ala al-Nafs
al-Waqf Ala al-Nafs).).
2/3/1 Waqf is said to be charitable when its income/usufruct is dedi-
cated for a charitable purpose.
2/3/2 A family Waqf is the Waqf in which the income/usufruct is
reserved  for  specifically  described  persons,  usually  family
members  and  relatives.  The  income/usufruct  of  such  Waqf
goes  to  a  charitable  purpose  when  none  of  these  persons  is
existent.
2/3/3 Joint Waqf refers to the case in which the property is donated to
family as well as charitable purposes, and the income/usufruct
here is shared accordingly.
2/3/4 In case of self-dedicated Waqf the donor retains the income/
usufruct  of  the  donated  property  for  himself  as  long  as  he
is alive, and indicates the charitable purpose which shall be
entitled to the income/usufruct of the Waqf after his death.
3. Basic Elements of Waqf
  The basic elements of Waqf include: The form of donation, the Waqif
(the donor) and the donated property.
3/1  The form of the Waqf
3/1/1 The  form  of  the  Waqf  comprises  offer  only,  as  it  does  not
necessitate acceptance. When a legally competent beneficiary
rejects a Waqf that has been earmarked for him, his rejection
has to be concurred to, yet the Waqf shall still remain valid. In
this case the Waqf- or the share of the rejecting beneficiary if
beneficiaries are many - should go to charitable purposes.
3/1/2 Formation  of  Waqf  can  take  place  verbally,  in  writing,  or  in
any form of disposition which is normally considered as indi-
cating it.
815815
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
3/1/3 Waqf can be declared as effective starting from a future date, as
when the donor declares his property to become Waqf starting
from next year.
3/1/4 In principle Waqf should be eternal. Nevertheless temporary
Waqf is also permissible when the donor desires to get back
his property after a specific period.
3/2  The Waqif (donor)
3/2/1 The Waqif can be a natural or a legal person. If the Waqif is is
3/2/1 The Waqif can be a natural or a legal person. If the Waqif
a  legal  person,  the  Waqf  decision  should  be  made  by  the
general assembly and not the board of directors.
3/2/2 The Waqif must be legally eligible for disposing of his property.
3/2/3 The  Waqf  decision  of  a  person  whose  legal  competence  is
restricted  because  of  irrationality  is  invalid,  except  when  he
declares his property as Waqf for himself as long as he is alive.
The  validity  of  the  Waqf  decision  of  a  person  whose  legal
competence  is  restricted  because  of  indebtedness  depends
on confirmation by his creditors. When the creditors refrain
from confirming the Waqf of the indebted person, the Waqf
becomes invalid.
3/3  The beneficiary
3/3/1 The Waqf should not be made for an impermissible purpose,
although it may not be for a charitable purpose since the very
beginning of its inception.
3/3/2 It is permissible to make Waqf for the benefit of non-Muslims,
provided that the cause to be served does not involve a sin. It
is also permissible to make Waqf for the benefit of the rich.
3/3/3  The Waqf beneficiary need not be present at the time of declaring
the Waqf.
3/3/4 When  the  beneficiary/beneficiaries  of  the  Waqf  is/are  no
longer existent, the benefits of the Waqf should go to charity
purposes.
816816
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
3/4  The Waqf property
3/4/1 The Waqf property should fulfill the following conditions:
a) It shall be a Shariah-accepted property
b) It shall be known
c) The Waqif shall be the sole owner of the property in which
nobody else should have a right of disposition at the time of
establishing the Waqf. If the Waqif himself has the option of
disposing of the property, the Waqf shall become valid, and
the option is spontaneously cancelled.
3/4/2 The Waqf has a legal personality and financial liability which
make it capable of giving and accepting commitment. The legal
personality of the Waqf is quite separate from the personality
of its manager.
3/4/3 Types of Waqf properties
3/4/3/1 Waqf is permissible in real estate along with permanent
furniture and fittings.
3/4/3/1 Waqf  is  permissible  in  movable  assets,  whether  such
movable assets are part of a real estate or independent.
3/4/3/2 Waqf  is  permissible  in  money.  The  income  generated
from utilization of the money is to be spent, while re-
taining  the  principal  amount.  Utilization  may  include,
for instance, Shariah-based lending as well as permis-
sible  and  safe  investments  like  Mudarabah  where  the
profit share owned by the Waqf goes to beneficiaries.
3/4/3/4 Waqf  is  permissible  in  Shariah-accepted  shares  and
Sukuk. In this case, the income earned by these shares
or  Sukuk  is  to  be  spent  on  the  Waqf  beneficiaries.
In case of liquidation the Shariah rulings on
Istibdal
In case of liquidation the Shariah rulings on Istibdal
(exchange of Waqf property) should be applied.
3/4/4 Waqf in common property
3/4/4/1 Waqf can be a common property, whether such property
property in this
is divisible or not. The whole common property in this
is divisible or not. The whole common

Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
case (not shares or Sukuk), can be leased and the Waqf
gets its respective share of the rent.
Alternatively, the share of the Waqf in the common
property  can  be  leased,  so  that  the  usufruct  can
property  can  be  leased,  so  that  the  usufruct  can  be be
utilized through time-based and place-based Muhaya`h
(succession),  while  the  rental  income  goes  to  the
beneficiaries of the Waqf.
3/4/4/2 When the Waqf superintendent or the Waqf partner asks
for  the  division  of  an  indivisible  Waqf,  the  refraining
party  should  be  forced  to  accept  selling.  The  income
obtained from selling the Waqf in this manner should
be  used  for  purchasing  a  Waqf  property  of  the  same
kind.
If such request for division is made in case of a divisible
Waqf, the refraining party should be forced to accept
division.

(transcendence) when the upper floor is declared as Waqf while
the owner of the lower floor is unable to perform construction.
The lower floor in such case can be built at the cost of the Waqf
(on  permission  of  the  concerned  authorities)  and  the  cost
reimbursed to the Waqf from the income generated through
its leasing.
3/4/6 Waqf as a usufructs
Waqf  can  be  a  usufruct  of  an  asset  which  the  Waqif  acquires
through rent. The Waqif can lease the asset once again, and the
proceeds go to the Waqf beneficiaries. The Waqf, in this case, is
to be made temporary according to the period of the original
818818
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
rent. Waqf can take place in this manner when the owner of the
property does not deprive the lessee the right of subleasing.
4. Condition in Waqf
4/1  Conditions pertaining to the Waqf contract
4/1/1 The Waqif has the right to make his Waqf subject to all condi-
tions which do not contradict with Shariah, and his conditions
shall be as enforceable as Shariah conditions. The conditions of
every Waqif must be understood with due consideration to the
prevailing norms in his environment. Such conditions may in-
clude, for example, designating a certain superintendent for the
Waqf and specifying his remuneration package. The designated
superintendent could be an individual, a group of people, or
institution.
an an institution.
4/1/2 Regarding the form of the Waqf, the Waqif can make a condition
that his debts should be settled from the Waqf income; after his
death,  or  he  may  stipulate  a  condition  that  the  income  of  his
Waqf should go to him first as long as he is alive, then to his
family, and finally to charitable purposes. Another condition of
the Waqif could be that the Waqf income has to be spent first
on any member of his family who becomes poor, and then on
charity purposes.
4/1/3 A condition stipulated by the Waqif is invalid when it comprises
an impermissible element, or when it violates the Shariah rulings
on Waqf or cause harm to the Waqf property. In such cases the
condition should be rejected and the Waqf shall remain valid.
Examples of invalid conditions include: absolute forbiddance of
Istibdal
 (exchange) of the Waqf, or forbiddance of the dismissal
Istibdal (exchange) of the Waqf, or forbiddance of the dismissal
of the Waqf superintendent for any reason.
A condition stipulated by the Waqif also becomes invalid when
it tends to hinder the interests of the Waqf, or jeopardize the
process of benefiting from it. The example of this is a condition
which requires starting - at all times - with distribution of the
819819
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
Waqf income among the beneficiaries, even if the Waqf is in
need of maintenance or renovation.
4/1/4 When the Waqif stipulates a condition that the Waqf should be
benefited from through residence, the Waqf can be benefited
from either in that manner, or through leasing, and vice versa.
5. Supervision and Management of Waqf
5/1  Controls on supervision and management of Waqf
  Supervision and management of Waqf should observe the Shariah
rulings on Waqf, then the conditions of the Waqif which do not
contradict  with  Shariah  or  hinder  the  interests  of  the  Waqf  as
perceived by the judiciary.
5/2  Tasks of the Waqf superintendent
  The Waqf Superintendent should perform the following tasks, among
others:
5/2/1 Management, maintenance and development of the Waqf.
5/2/2 Leasing of the assets or usufructs of the Waqf (through oper-
ating-lease contracts), and leasing of the Waqf lands.
5/2/3 Development of the Waqf properties either directly in Shariah-
sanctioned methods of investment, or through Islamic financial
institutions.
5/2/4 Increasing the Waqf money by investing it through Mudarabah
and other similar forms.
5/2/5 Changing  the  operational  form  of  the  Waqf  assets  with  the
aim  of  maximizing  the  benefit  that  results  to  the  Waqf  and
its  beneficiaries.  This  may  include,  for  instance,  converting
a residential building into a commercial building, or construct-
ing buildings for rent on an agricultural land, provided that this
would satisfy the demand of the people, generate more income
for the Waqf and is done with the permission of the concerned
authorities.

Waqf,  and  payment  of  expenses  for  documentation  of  the
assets and the rights of the Waqf.
5/2/7 Settlement of the debts of the Waqf.

5/2/10 Safeguarding the Waqf properties against occupation or seizure
by others.
5/2/11  Using solidarity insurance to safeguard the Waqf assets, whenever
possible.
5/2/12  Preparation of the Waqf accounts, and submission of statements
and reports on them to the concerned authorities.
5/3  What shall not be done by the Waqf Superintendent
  The Waqf superintendent shall not do the following:
5/3/1 Neglecting the conditions of the Waqif.
5/3/2 Leasing the Waqf to himself or to one of his dependant sons -
even if such leasing is at more than the normal rent  except
through the judiciary. He should not also lease the Waqf to one
of his direct relatives (Usul and Frua) or to his spouse, for less
than the normal rent of similar property. In this case, minor
injustice (Ghabn) is not forgivable, although it is forgivable in
leasing to nonrelatives.
5/3/3 Using  the  Waqf  income  for  increasing  the  Waqf  properties,
except when this is done in fulfillment of a condition stipulated
by the Waqif.
5/3/4 Mortgaging the Waqf assets for a debt to be obtained for the
Waqf or the beneficiaries.
821821
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
5/3/5 Lending the Waqf assets, and if he does so, the borrower has to
pay the normal rent for similar assets.
5/3/6  Borrowing  for  the  Waqf,  except  in  fulfillment  of  a  condition
stipulated by the Waqif, or on permission of the legal authorities,
and in case of necessity. In borrowing for the Waqf the following
should be observed:
5/3/6/1 Establishing a debt obligation on the Waqf is permis-
sible  through  permissible  means  of  borrowing,  or
deferred payment purchase, or any other permissible
mode of financing. Establishing the debt through any
of these modes has to be for the sake of maintaining
and developing the Waqf, as per a condition stipulated
by  the  Waqif,  or  on  permission  of  the  legal  authori-
ties, and due to necessity. In establishing the debt, due
consideration shall also be given to the ability of the
Waqf to bear such debt and sufficiency of its income
for repayment. These restricted forms of establishing
debt obligations on the Waqf do not include the case
when the Waqf superintendent pays a certain amount
of money from his own sources for an interest which
concerns  the  Waqf,  and  the  Waqf  has  sufficient  in-
come to be resorted to for settlement of such debt.
5/3/6/2 Cases  which  justify  borrowing  for  the  Waqf,  when
borrowing is not sanctioned by a condition stipulated
by the Waqif:
a)  Need for maintenance or necessary development of
the Waqf and absence of sufficient Waqf income for
that.
b) Payment of financial commitments  if any  when
b)  Payment of financial commitments  if any  when
the Waqf does not have sufficient funds.
c)  Inability to pay the wages of the employees working
in  the  Waqf  or  those  who  serve  its  purposes,  and
fear from endangering the benefits of the Waqf.
822822
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
5/3/6/3 Borrowing should not be for the sake of spending on
the beneficiaries of the Waqf.
5/4  Spending the excess income of the Waqf of a mosque
In  principle  the  income  of  the  Waqf  of  a  specific  mosque  is  to  be
spent on its own interests. If there is still an excess amount of income
which has not been spent, it is permissible to transfer such amount
to another mosque that does not have enough income to cover its
expenses, or the cost of its maintenance and renovation.
5/5  Judicial supervision on Waqf management
5/5/1 By virtue of public guardianship, the judiciary has the authority
of overseeing the supervision and management of the Waqf,
preservation of its assets, and development of its sources. The
judiciary has also the right of investigating the overall status of
the Waqf, looking into any complaints raised against the Waqf
superintendent  or  any  other  party,  and  subjecting  the  Waqf
superintendent to disciplinary action.
6. Controls on Leasing of Waqf Assets
6/1 In  principle,  a  long  period  of  leasing  should  not  be  the  normal
practice for Waqf assets, except for obvious interest, and provided
that a variable rent, linked to an accurate and well known index,
is going to be sought. [see Shariah Standard No. (9) on Ijarah and
Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, item 5/2/3]
6/2  The normal rent of similar property as a condition
  Waqf assets or usufructs should not be leased at less than the rent of
similar property. When leasing at a lower rent is inevitable it should
be considered in view of the actual necessity, and hence, excessive

a  new  tenant  who  can  pay  the  rent  of  similar  property,  the  Waqf

unless the old tenant accepts the rent increment. If the normal rent
for the Waqf in question has risen because of developing the Waqf

the tenant is obliged to accept rent increment. If land development
and construction of the building is done at the cost of the tenant, he
is not bound to accept the rent increment.
6/3  Some permissible forms of Waqf leasing
6/3/1 Signing a lease contract with the aim of keeping the Waqf land
in the hands of the tenant as long as he pays the normal rent
for similar property as it changes according to circumstances.
This type of contract is known as (

This type of contract is known as (HikrHikr) and is subject to the
following conditions:

property along with a lump sum amount for development of the
Waqf. In some countries, this contractual form is known as (
Waqf. In some countries, this contractual form is known as (al-al-
KhuluKhulu).).
7. Application of Modes of Investment for Development of Waqf Income
and Assets
7/1  It is permissible to invest Waqf income, in the following cases:
1-  As per a condition stipulated by the Waqif.
2-  During the waiting period (prior to identification of beneficiaries).
3-  Excess income, after payment to beneficiaries.
824824
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
Investment in these cases should be through permissible methods
such  as  Mudarabah,  Musharakah,  Murabahah,  Ijarah,  and  Salam,
and in low risk investments.
7/2  For development of the Waqf land, the following is permissible:
7/2/1 Application  of  the  Istisnaa  through  B.O.T.  contracts.  [see
Shariah Standard No. (11) on Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa,
item 3/2/1]
7/2/2 Application of diminishing Musharakah, where the Waqf and
the  financing  partner  construct  the  building  through  joint
financing (excluding the Waqf land), and the Waqf gradually
owns the building. [see Shariah Standard No. (12) on Sharikah
(Musharakh) and Modern Corporations, item 5/8]
7/2/3 Application  of  Ijarah  Muntahia  Bittamleek  for  a  specifically
described property to be delivered in the future. In this case, the
Waqf land is leased to the financier who constructs a building
on it and delivers it to the Waqf to execute the lease contract.
At the end of the contracting period, the Waqf becomes the
owner of the building. [see Shariah Standard No. (9) on Ijarah
and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, item 3/5]
7/3  All appropriate means should be adopted for development of Awqaf,
with due consideration to Shariah rulings on Waqf and the conditions
stipulated by the Waqifs, as well as present day requirements.
7/4  Help in this regard should be sought from Islamic financial institu-
tions, specialized in Waqf investments.
8. Maintenance, Renovation and Replacement of Waqf Assets
8/1 Maintenance  and  renovation  of  Waqf  assets,  and  allocation  of
reserves for that purpose

Waqf assets should precede distribution of the Waqf income
among beneficiaries. In this connection, due consideration shall

Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
Maintenance and reparation of Waqf assets also do not require
a prior condition to be stipulated by the Waqif.
8/1/2 Maintenance  and  renovation  requirements  (maintenance
reserve) shall be retained from the Waqf income every year
even  if  the  Waqif  has  not  stipulated  such  a  condition.  The
reserve, thus deducted, can be invested in a safe and easy to
liquidate form of investment, and the returns be added to the
principal  amount.  The  beneficiaries  shall  have  no  right  on
the maintenance reserve, unless part of it turns out to be in
excess of actual needs.
8/1/3 In  the  absence  of  sufficient  amounts  for  maintenance  and
renovation of a leased Waqf asset, the Waqf superintendent
has the right to allow the tenant to make such maintenance
and  renovation,  against  having  the  priority  to  continue  as
a tenant of the Waqf asset until getting full repayment of his
debt.
8/1/4 Solidarity insurance shall be used for maintenance or renova-
tion of the Waqf assets.
8/2  Making allocations for replacement of Waqf assets
It is permissible to deduct from the Waqf income (after distribution
to beneficiaries) periodical amounts commensurate to the economic
lifetime of the depreciating Waqf assets, so as to use the accumulated
amount for replacement of these assets (depreciation allowance).

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
On 5 Rabi I, 1427 A.H., corresponding to 4 April 2006 A.D., the Secretariat
General decided to assign to a Shariah consultant the preparation of a study
on Waqf.
On 8-9 Rabi I, 1427 A.H., corresponding to 6-7 April 2006 A.D., a joint
meeting  of  the  Shariah  Standards  Committees  (1)  and  (2)  was  held  in
Makkah Al-Mukarramah, and discussed the study. The meeting requested
the  consultant  to  introduce  necessary  amendments  in  the  light  of  the
discussions and observations of the joint committee members.
On  19  Shawwal  1427  A.H.,  corresponding  to  10  November  2006
A.D., the Shariah Standards Committee (2) held a meeting in Manama
(Kingdom of Bahrain) in which it discussed the draft of the standard and
requested the consultant to introduce necessary amendments in the light
of the discussions and observations of the meeting.

banks, Institutions, and accounting firms. The session was also attended by
Shariah  scholars,  university  teachers  and  other  interested  parties.  Several
observations  were  made  in  the  session,  and  duly  responded  to  by  the

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  The  basis  for  considering  Waqf  (in  principle)  as  a  permissible  and  re-
The  basis  for  considering  Waqf  (in  principle)  as  a  permissible  and  re-
commendable practice (Mandub) is the Quranic Verses which instruct
people to do good and spend on charitable causes, and also the Hadith
(Prophetic  tradition)  which  indicates:
When  a  person  dies  his  rightful
(Prophetic  tradition)  which  indicates:  When  a  person  dies  his  rightful
deeds will stop except in three respects: An ongoing charity Sadaqah Ja-
riyah....
 Waqf is considered to be the ongoing charity referred to in the
riyah.... Waqf is considered to be the ongoing charity referred to in the
Hadith, because the beneficiary does not own the Waqf asset, and accor-
dingly, cannot dispose of it.
Moreover, there is the Hadith about the piece of land in Khybar which
Umar donated as Waqf, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised
him to do so.
Again, permissibility of Waqf is supported by the practice of the Sahabah
(Prophets  Companions)  like  Uthman  and  Abu  Talhah,  in  addition  to
Ijma (
). Waqf for charitable purposes can also be
consensus of Fuqaha). Waqf for charitable purposes can also be

justified through Qiyas (analogical deduction) in comparison to Waqf
for mosques.
Enforceability of the Waqf when it is indicated by a donor in his will, stems
from the fact that according to Shariah a will should be executed, and its
alteration or cancelation is strictly prohibited.

  Acceptance  of  the  Waqf  is  not  a  condition  for  its  validity  when  the
Acceptance  of  the  Waqf  is  not  a  condition  for  its  validity  when  the
beneficiary is not specified, because acceptance cannot be expected in
this case. In case of a specific beneficiary, acceptance can be obtained
from him even if implicitly when he keeps silent. The ruling that when
the beneficiary rejects the Waqf his rights in the Waqf shall be dropped,
whereas the Waqf should still remain valid, is based on the viewpoint of
831831
Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
the Hanafi School of fiqh. The justification here is that the beneficiary
can  drop  his  own  rights  in  the  Waqf,  but  he  cannot  nullify  the  Waqf
itself.
  Waqf inception can be subject to any form of disposition which traditio-
Waqf inception can be subject to any form of disposition which traditio-
nally indicates it, because traditions are usually recognizable, when they
do not contradict with Shariah rulings.
  Permissibility of temporary Waqf is based on the viewpoints of the Maliki
Permissibility of temporary Waqf is based on the viewpoints of the Maliki
and the Imami Schools of Fiqh, in addition to what has been reported
about the viewpoint of Abu Yusuf of the Hanafi School. Such viewpoint
is based on the fact that a temporary Waqf can also fulfill its charitable
objectives and result in two benefits: one of them is the benefit generated
from Waqf throughout its specified period, and the other is the benefit
to  the  Waqif  since  he  may  need  his  property  in  the  future.  Moreover,
permissibility  of  temporary  Waqf  could  encourage  Waqf  practicing,
and,  hence,  contribute  to  fulfillment  of  the  present  need  for  charitable
institutions.

  Prohibition of Waqf by a person who is legally restricted for irrationality,
aims at safeguarding his creditors, his own self, and his dependants. There
is no harm, however, when the irrational person declares the Waqf for

it should be subject to the rulings applicable to the will of such person.

Shariah Standard No. (33): Waqf
  The ruling that Waqf can be made for a person who is nonexistent at the
The ruling that Waqf can be made for a person who is nonexistent at the
time  of  establishing  the  Waqf,  is  based  on  the  Hadiths  narrated  about
Waqf for progeny, and on the fact that Waqf is an ongoing charity and
therefore it should include those who will exist in the future.
Waqf is said to have a legal personality and financial liability which are quite
   Waqf is said to have a legal personality and financial liability which are quite
independent from those of its superintendent, because Waqf can give and
take commitments. When, for instance, the Waqf superintendent borrows
money for the Waqf, the debt obligation does not fall on him but rather on
the Waqf itself. Similarly, when the beneficiary fails to fulfill his obligation
towards  the  Waqf,  he  becomes  indebted  to  the  Waqf,  rather  than  to  the
Waqf superintendent. Therefore, in this case, the Waqf superintendent has
no right to relief the debtor from the debt.
  The ruling that Waqf donation should not exceed one third of the donors

Wasiyyah (will), where

part  of  the  wealth  should  be  left  to  the  inheritors  of  the  deceased  (the
obligatory entitlement as per Shariah). This has been explicitly referred to
in the Egyptian Law of Awqaf.
Permissibility of making Waqf in the form of moveable property, regardless
  Permissibility of making Waqf in the form of moveable property, regardless
of  its  nature  and  even  if  such  property  is  not  survivable,  is  based  on  the
ruling practice during the era of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon
him) and the orthodox caliphs with respect to making Waqfs for mosques.
The  majority  of  Fiqh  scholars  also  support  this  viewpoint;  whereas  the
Hanafi scholars hold that Waqf of moveable property is permissible only
when it is the normal practice.
  Money can be donated as a Waqf because this is the original form of Waqf,
Money can be donated as a Waqf because this is the original form of Waqf,
as emphasized by Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Al-Ansari the companion of
Imam  Zafar  and  supported  by  Ibn  Taymiyyah.  Shares  and  Sukuk  come
under this type of Waqf.
  A  usufruct  can  be  donated  as  Waqf,  because  it  is  wealth,  and  hence  it
A  usufruct  can  be  donated  as  Waqf,  because  it  is  wealth,  and  hence  it
should be subject to the general rules of Waqf. The fact that a usufruct is
temporary does not affect this ruling since Waqf can also be temporary
as has been indicated earlier.
The  ruling  that  permissible  conditions  of  the  Waqif  shall  be  observed
  The  ruling  that  permissible  conditions  of  the  Waqif  shall  be  observed
(including  the  ten  conditions),  is  based  on  the  Hadith  which  states:

The  basis  for  depriving  the  Waqf  superintendent  the  right  of  leasing

  The ruling that Waqf assets should not be leased for less than the normal
The ruling that Waqf assets should not be leased for less than the normal
rent of similar assets (while minor injustice could be accepted) is based on
the desire to avoid favoritism and waste of Waqf income. This viewpoint
enjoys  unanimous  agreement  of  Muslim  Fiqh  scholars.  The  viewpoint
regarding  termination  of  the  contract  when  the  normal  rent  of  similar
property increases and the Waqf tenant refuses rent increment belongs to
the Hanafi School, contrary to the Maliki and Shafii Schools who hold that
the contract should not be terminated if the lease contract is for a specific
period.

Permissibility of application of modern financing techniques which have
been  developed  by  Institutions  rests  on  the  fact  that  such  forms  are  in
conformity  with  the  usual  forms  of  land  leasing  and  cultivation.  Such
modern  forms  could  even  generate  more  income  than  the  traditional
ones, and achieve the goals of preservation and security of the Waqf assets.
  Permissibility of making a reserve fund for maintenance and renovation
Permissibility of making a reserve fund for maintenance and renovation
of the Waqf is based on the desire to preserve the Waqf assets and their
ability to generate income, as has been emphasized by a number of Fiqh
scholars.

Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  hiring  of  the  service/work  of  persons  between  the
institution and other institutions or individuals. The standard covers the
cases  when  the  institution  is  the  employee  and  when  it  is  the  employer.
However, the standard does not cover other contracts such as Mudarabah,
investment agency, Musaqat, Muzaraah, Mugharasah, and Istisnaa.
2. Definition of the Term Hiring of Persons
It refers to the contract through which a service/work of a natural or a legal
person is obtained against a specific amount of pay. The service thus ob-
tained could be specific or a future one that needs to be specified through
detailed terms of reference, such as educational, health and consultancy
services.
3. Pledge to Hire a Service
3/1  There is no Shariah prohibition against having a framework agreement
to regulate the process of hiring between the institution and the client.
Such agreement may comprise the general conditions which govern
the  relationship  between  the  two  parties,  whereas  there  should  be
a separate hiring contract for each operation, signed by both parties.
Under such framework agreement the two parties may also perform
operations through exchange offer and acceptance with due reference
to the general conditions stipulated in the agreement.
3/2  The institution has the right to ask the client who pledges to hire its
services to pay a specific amount to be retained by the institution as
a guarantee for the seriousness of the client in executing his pledge
and  honoring  any  commitments  that  may  result  from  it.  In  case
of  withdrawal  from  the  part  of  the  client  the  deduction  from  this
guarantee amount should not exceed the actual harm caused to the
844844
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
institution.  The  guarantee  amount  can  either  be  kept  as  a  deposit
with the institution without being disposed of, or invested on behalf
of the client through Islamic Mudarabah or investment agency, or
frozen in a current account owned by the client and guaranteed by
the institution. The institution and the client may also agree at the
time of signing the contract to consider the guarantee amount as
a a prepaid installment of the cost payable by the client. [see Shariah
prepaid installment of the cost payable by the client. [see Shariah
Standard  No.  (9)  on  Ijarah  and  Ijarah  Muntahia  Bittamleek,  item
2/3]2/3]
4. Concluding a Contract for Hiring of Persons
4/1  A  contract  for  hiring  of  persons  can  take  place  in  any  form  that
normally  indicates  it.  It  can  be  concluded  verbally,  in  writing  or
through modern means of communication.
4/2  The  two  parties  of  the  contract  (the  employer  and  the  employee)
4/2  The  two  parties  of  the  contract  (the  employer  and the  employee)
should  be  legally  competent  (capable  of  awarding  and  accepting
agency), otherwise the contract cannot be concluded.
4/3  A  private  employee,  who  works  for  and  under  the  supervision  of
a a single employer, has no right to work, at the same time, for anyone
single employer, has no right to work, at the same time, for anyone
else, except on permission of his former employer. Unlike a private
employee a shared employee who works for more than one person
and who is not supposed to work for a specific person at a specific
time, is not subject to such restriction.
4/4  The private employee should be informed about the hiring period
and  the  type  of  work  he  is  supposed  to  do  in  general,  while  the
shared employee should be informed about the work, its type, and
specifications. The specific period within which the work has to be
done could also be added, and in that case the employee has to do
the work within that specific period. When no specific period for
doing  the  work  is  referred  to  in  the  contract,  resort  should  be  to
normal practice.
4/5  A private employee is not responsible for damage, unless it is due to
his own transgression, negligence, or breach of a stipulated condition.
845845
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
4/6  A  shared  employee  is  absolutely  responsible  for  damage,  unless  it  is
caused by an evitable factor. This, however, does not hold true in the
case  of  an  investment  agent  who  is  permitted  to  utilize  the  money.
Unlike the shared employee who has to guarantee what he is paid to
work on, the investment agent does not guarantee, except in case of
transgression or negligence.
4/7  The contract for hiring of persons is a binding contract, which none
of the two parties can terminate or amend without the consent of the
other,  except  in  case  of  contract  breaching,  or  due  to  an  emergent
excuse, or because of inevitable circumstances.
4/8  For a private employee, the beginning of the hiring period should be
specified.  The  hiring  period  should  start  at  the  time  of  signing  the
contract, except when the two parties agree on a specific date for its
beginning. Hiring in the latter case is known as (deferred hiring), or
hiring that has to be executed in the future.
4/9  When a private employee fails to report to work on the date specified
in  the  hiring  contract  he  shall  be  entitled  to  no  pay  for  the  period
between the specified and actual dates of work commencement (the
pay for the absence period should be deducted from his total pay). The
employer  in  this  case  shall  have  the  right  to  terminate  the  contract,
unless the two parties agree on a compensatory period at the end of
the contract period.
4/10 For a shared employee, a certain period for performing the work may
be specified. When the shared employee fails to do the work during
that period, the employer has the right to terminate the contract or
a new period can be agreed upon.
4/11 There is no Shariah prohibition for any of the two types of employees
(private  and  shared)  to  receive  Arboun  (Earnest  Money)  at  the
time of signing the contract. If the hiring contract is implemented,
the  amount  of  earnest  money  should  become  a  prepaid  part  of
the  employees  pay,  otherwise  the  earnest  money  should  go  to  the
employee. However, when the contract is not executed the employee
846846
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
is  preferably  supposed  to  take  from  such
is  preferably  supposed  to  take  from  such  earnest  money

  only  the
earnest  money  only  the
5. Subject Matter of Hiring Contract
  The subject matter of the hiring contract is the service/work and the pay.
5/1  Rulings pertaining to the service/work
5/1/1  The  service/work  of  the  employee  which  constitutes  a  subject
matter  of  the  contract  should  be  well  known,  accomplishable
and permissible in Shariah.
5/1/2  It is permissible to determine service in terms of a specific work
to be done or a specific period of service, or in terms of both.
If the employee is able to do all the work within the specified
period,  he  becomes  entitled  to  the  whole  pay.  If  he  is  able  to
do only part of it during the period, his entitlement to the pay
will depend on two probable outcomes. If the part of the work
he has done during the period is in fact useless and cannot be
benefited from the employee shall become entitled to no pay. If
the accomplished part of the work is useful and can be benefited
from, and the employer is unwilling to extend the period, the
employee shall become entitled to the amount normally paid for
similar work (Ajr al-Mithl
similar work (
Ajr al-Mithl).).
5/1/3 When a person is hired for doing a specific service/work, the
employer  has  no  right  to  hire  out  the  service/work  of  such
person  to  a  sub-employer,  unless  the  contract  permits  sub-
hiring,  or  this  has  been  agreed  upon  by  the  two  parties.  If
the  hired  service/work  is  specifically  defined  and  has  to  be
delivered in the future, the employer in this case has the right
to hire out to someone else an identical service/work (Parallel
hiring). [see Shariah Standard No. (17) on Investment Sukuk,
item 5/2/10]
5/1/4  The employer should stick to utilizing the work/service of the
hired person as per the permissible conditions that have been
agreed upon.
847847
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
5/1/5  When  the  hiring  contract  relates  to  a  specific  service,  the
employee (the institution) should own the service and have the
ability to deliver it. Hence, it is impermissible for the institution
to sign a contract with the client before it possesses the service
and  becomes  in  a  position  to  perform  actual  or  constructive
delivery.
5/1/6  Hiring  can  be  for  performing  a  future  service  that  is  well
described  and  specified  to  the  extent  which  leaves  no  room
for ambiguity and dispute. In that case the employer does not
have  to  own  the  required  service  before  signing  the  contract.
Consequently, an agreement may be reached for performing the
service at a specific time in the future, with due consideration
to  the  ability  of  the  employee  to  own  the  service  and  become
able to deliver it on time, by himself or through someone else.
The pay for the service here should not necessarily be made in
advance, unless the contract is a Salam or Salaf contract. If the
employee happens to deliver a service that does not conform to
what has been agreed upon, the employer has the right to reject
it and insist on having a service that conforms to specifications.
5/2  Rulings pertaining to the pay
5/2/1  The pay, whether in cash, or in-kind or in the form of a service,
should  be  well  known  to  the  extent  that  leaves  no  room  for
dispute. It can be either fixed or variable according to a method
which is well known to the two parties.
5/2/2 The pay can be determined for the work as a whole so that
the employee becomes entitled to it after doing all the work,
or  it  can  be  determined  in  installments  and  the  employee
becomes entitled to each installment at the relevant stage of
the work done. The pay can also be determined on the basis of
a specific period, after which the employee becomes entitled
to it, or such period can be divided into sub-periods and the
pay  determined  accordingly.  Furthermore,  the  pay  can  be
determined  on  the  basis  of  both  the  work  and  the  period,
848848
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
and the employee becomes entitled to it when he performs
the work within the specified period. [see item 5/2/9]
5/2/3 The  pay  becomes  obligatory  when  the  two  parties  sign  the
contract, and payable on delivery of the service/work or making
it  available  (when  the  employee  puts  himself  at  the  disposal
of  the  employer  even  if  the  employer  has  not  yet  assigned
a task to him). After signing the contract, there is no Shariah
prohibition against forwarding the pay as a lump sum amount,
or in installments.
5/2/4  The pay can be variable, yet the amount of pay for the first period
should be known. Following the first period, it is permissible to
use an accurate indicator for predetermination of the pay for the
successive periods. However, such indicator should be known to
both parties and mutually agreed upon, for avoidance of dispute.
This  indicator  which  replaces  the  specifically  determined  pay
for the period should have an upper and a lower limit.
5/2/5 It is permissible, on the consent of the two parties, to amend
the  pay  of  future  periods  (the  periods  in  which  benefiting
from the service has not yet taken place), whereas the unpaid
amounts of pay that relate to past periods become a debt ob-
gation owed by the employer, and hence it is impermissible
liligation owed by the employer, and hence it is impermissible
to stipulate a condition for increasing such amounts (resched-
uling).
5/2/6  The pay can be determined as a percentage of the output (e.g.,
10%) or a part of the thing to be made.
5/2/7 It  is  permissible  to  stipulate  in  the  contract  that  in  case  of
default by the employer in the settlement of any installment,
or  when  he  refrains  from  doing  so  without  a  reasonable
excuse and after a sufficient period of notification; all other
installments  shall  become  due  and  eligible  for  premature
settlement. However, the employee in this case does not own
the prepaid installments finally until he completes the work
of the whole hiring period. [see Shariah Standard No. (8) on
Murabahah, item 5/1]
849849
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
5/2/8 It is impermissible to make a condition which leads to any
increment in the pay agreed upon, in case of default by the
employer. Nevertheless, the contract may include a pledge by
the employer to donate, in case of default, a percentage of the
pay for charitable purposes. Such donation should entirely go
to charitable purposes, under the supervision of the Shariah
Board of the institution.
5/2/9  It is permissible to agree upon more than one rate of pay, as when
the two parties agree that if the work is done within a certain
period  the  pay  will  be  this  much,  and  if  it  is  done  in  another
(shorter)  period  the  pay  will  increase  to  that  much.  Similarly,
two  different  rates  of  pay  can  also  be  linked  to  two  different
places, types, or specializations, of the work to be done.
6. Guarantees for Provision of the Pay and the Service
6/1  The employee has the right to obtain the permissible guarantees in
their different forms so as to document his eligibility for receiving
the pay. Likewise, the employer has also the right to obtain such
guarantees for receiving indemnity in case of any transgression or
negligence or breach of the contract from the part of the employ-
ee.  The  ruling  here  is,  in  fact,  similar  to  that  on  documentation
and collateralization  (Rahn),
 (Kafalah) transfer of right
suretyship (Kafalah) transfer of right
and collateralization  (Rahn), suretyship
(Hawalat al-Haqq
) and set-off (Maqassah). [see Shariah Standard
Hawalat al-Haqq) and set-off (Maqassah). [see Shariah Standard
No. (5) on Guarantees, item 2/3]
6/2  It is permissible to state in the contract that the pay has to be made in
advance, deferred, or in installments. In case of premature termination
of a contract in which the pay has already been made in advance, the
two parties should resort to settlement. When the employee accepts
any period of delay for a pay that has to be settled in advance, such
acceptance should be considered as a respite which the employee has
willingly granted to the employer, and hence it can by no means be
considered as a right of the latter. Due attention shall be given here to
item 5/2/2.
850850
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
7. Commitments of the Employee and the Employer
7/1  Commitments of the employee
7/1/1 The private employee has to render his service to the employer
and observe the period of hiring during which he should not
be absent, except on permission of the employer, or to perform
a  recognizable  duty.  Similarly,  the  shared  employee  has  to
perform  the  work  as  agreed  upon,  and  within  the  stipulated
period, if any.
7/1/2  In principle, the employee is supposed to do the work by himself
since he has been hired to perform a specific work required from
him, unless the contract stipulates otherwise. This, however, does
not hold true in case of hiring someone to do a future service/
work that has been specifically defined. In this latter case, what
needs  to  be  catered  for  is  observation  of  all  the  specifications
mentioned in the contract.
7/1/3 In hiring of persons, it is permissible to stipulate a penalty code
indicating a specific amount which the employee should pay to
the employer in case of delay in performing the work/service
within  the  specified  period.  The  amount  to  be  thus  paid  has
to be determined with due consideration to normal practice as
well as justice.
7/2  Commitments of the employer
7/2/1  The employer shall observe the following:
a) Payment of the pay in advance, on deferred payment basis, or
in installments as agreed upon. In the absence of agreement
on a specific form of payment, the due pay should be paid
after rendering the complete service to the employer, or on
expiry  of  the  hiring  period  in  case  of  private  employment.
When a due pay is delayed by the employer in spite of noti-
fication the employee has the right to stop work or prevent
the employer from utilizing the service that has already been
done.
851851
Shariah Standard No. (34): Hiring of Persons
b) Provision of facilities/requirements to the employee, if the
work to be done so requires, or when provision of such fa-
cilities and requirements is stipulated in the contract.
8. Emergencies, Termination, Expiry and Renewal of Hiring Contracts
8/1  Emergencies of hiring
8/1/1 A  private  or  shared  hiring  contract  which  relates  to  the
employee in person as per normal practice, shall be terminated
on the death of the employee, or when the employee loses his
entire legal competence, or when - due to injury or sickness
- he becomes unable to work anymore or for a period which
is  normally  considered  to  be  too  long  for  the  employer  to
tolerate.  Such  contract  shall  also  be  terminated  when  the
employee-institution encounters liquidation, bankruptcy, or
freezing of activities.
8/1/2 When  the  employee  refrains  from  delivery  of  the  service  as
required, and fails to present the suitable alternative as agreed
upon, the employer has the right to terminate the contract and
demand indemnification for the actual harm caused to him by
the act of the employee.
8/2  Termination, expiry and renewal of hiring contracts
8/2/1  In  specific  hiring,  when  the  service/work  becomes  completely
useless  the  contract  becomes  null  and  void;  whereas  when  it
is partially useless the employer has the right to terminate the
contract.  If,  instead,  the  service/work  that  has  become  useless
pertains to hiring on the basis of future delivery of a well defined
service, the contract shall remain valid, and the employee, in this
case, has to deliver a similar service.

As  far  as  Sunnah  is  concerned,  permissibility  of  hiring  of  persons  can

  The ruling that hiring for a specific service is impermissible before owning

things that one does not own, and the Hadith which has been narrated by
Hakim Ibn Hizam stating:

necessarily be made in advance.
  A private employee should not guarantee what he works on, except in case
A private employee should not guarantee what he works on, except in case
of transgression, negligence, or breach of a condition. This is actually the
general principle in trust-based contracts; in addition to that, the contract
comprises  an  interest  for  the  employee  since  he  will  receive  the  pay.  In
case of transgression, negligence, or breach of condition the act results in
harm, and hence the employee has to indemnify the employer, as per the

  The pay for future hiring periods can be adjusted on mutual consent of
The pay for future hiring periods can be adjusted on mutual consent of
the two parties, because such adjustment constitutes contract renewal
for a coming period. No pay has yet become payable to the employee
for that future period so that it can become a debt owed the employer,
and  consequently  lead  to  prohibited  rescheduling  of  debt.  When,
instead, such adjustment is done for an unsettled amount of pay which
belongs to past periods, so as to extend the repayment period against an
increase in the amount to be paid, adjustment in this case will lead to
Riba (usury). The 11thth Seminar of Al Baraka has already issued a Fatwa

becomes null and void on the death, loss of legal competency or persistent
sickness of the employee, is based on the fact that the object of contracting
will, thus, become no longer existent. Consequently, there will also be no

that, this ruling conforms to normal practice.

Preface
This  standard  aims  to  identify  the  Zakah  base  for  Islamic  financial
Institutions (Institution/Institutions),(1)(1) and indicate the different types of
Institutions (Institution/Institutions),
 and indicate the different types of
zakatable assets and the liabilities (debts of the Institution) and allocations
that have to be deducted from them. The standard also aims to illustrate the
payable Zakah rates, and indicate the specific heads of Zakah disbursements.
 The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial

Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  identification  of  the  Zakah  base  for  Institutions
(including Islamic insurance companies) as well as the subsidiary and
the mother company of the Institution (the company). This will be done
through identification of the items of financial statements that should or
should not be included in calculation of the Zakah base, and the liabilities
or  allocations  that  should  or  should  not  be  deducted  from  Zakatable
assets.  The  standard  also  covers  payable  Zakah  rates,  disbursement  of
Zakah funds on the eight categories of Zakah recipients, and the rulings
pertaining to disbursement.
2. Procedural Rulings
2/1  Methods of calculation of Zakah base
  There are two methods for calculation of Zakah base: the first is the
method of net assets, and the second is the method of net investment
assets.  The  two  methods  have  different  bases  of  assessment,  yet  if
such difference is well recognized the final outcome will be the same.
This standard is based on the net assets method.
  Net Assets Method
2/1/1 Calculation of Zakah base by using the net assets method is
done as follows:
Zakah base = Zakatable assets  (liabilities payable during the
financial year as at the date of the balance sheet + all installments
of liabilities of the financial year which will become due during
the  coming  financial  period  +  rights  of  the  holders  of  non-
restricted  investment  accounts  +  minority  rights  +sovereign
rights +waqf rights + charitable rights + rights of non-profit-
earning organizations that have no specific owner).
870870
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
Zakatable  assets  include:  cash  and  the  like,  receivables  (mi-
nus)  doubtful  debts,  assets  prepared  for  trading  (such  as
goods, financial papers and real estate), and financing assets
(Mudarabah,  Musharakah,  Salam,  Istisnaa..).  Deductions
from financial assets include fixed assets relating to them as
well as deductible allocations as shown in item 7.
2/1/2 Assets prepared for trade are to be assessed in terms of their
expected  cash  value  (selling  market  value)  at  the  time  when
expected  cash  value (selling market value)  at  the  time  when
Zakah is due.
2/1/3 In determination of zakatable assets in agriculture and livestock
other than articles of trade, application of the ratios and rates
specified by Shariah should be observed.
2/2  Direct payment of Zakah by the institution
2/2/1 The institution or the company is committed to pay Zakah
under the following cases:
a) Enactment of an enforceable Zakah law.
b) Stipulation of commitment to pay Zakah in the articles of
association.
c) Issuance of a Zakah commitment resolution by the general
assembly.
2/2/2 When  the  Institution  accepts  agency  for  payment  of  Zakah
on behalf of all or some of its equity holders or the holders of
investment accounts, funds should be available - or submitted
by the principals of such agency - for payment of Zakah on
their behalf.
2/2/3 There should be coordination between the mother Company
and its subsidiaries with regard to payment of Zakah so as to
avoid double payment.
2/2/4 In case of establishing a Zakah fund, or preparing Zakah ac-
counts, clearance by the Shariah Board of the institution or
the  company  should  be  obtained.  Clearance  by  the  Shariah
871871
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
Board is particularly required for disbursement of the Zakah
funds, when performed directly by the institution/company,
or through an accredited Zakah agency. Moreover, a compre-
hensive report on Zakah disbursements should be presented
to the Shariah Board on annual basis.
2/2/5  In the absence of any of the conditions indicated in item (2/2/1)
above,  payment  of  Zakah  shall  become  the  responsibility  of
shareholders  and  holders  of  the  investment  accounts.  In  this
case the Institution or the company has to indicate the amount of
Zakah payable per share or per a given balance of an investment
account.
2/3  Zakah-related financial statements
2/3/1 The Balance sheet
Due to the fact that Zakah relates to ownership of zakatable
assets, what matters to the Institutions in Zakah calculation
is  the  financial  data  included  in  the  balance  sheet  of  the
institution  (the  budget),  which  comprises  assets,  liabilities,
and their related allocations.
2/3/2 Income statement
Income  statement  (profit  and  loss  account)  does  not  form
a basis for Zakah calculation, yet it is referred to for knowing
the  income  or  profit  of  the  income-earning  fixed  assets.  In
order to pay Zakah the Institution should not necessarily be
making  profits.  Incurring  losses  by  the  Institution  does  not
prevent  Zakah  from  becoming  due.  The  Institution  is  still
committed to pay Zakah, except when its liabilities (debtors)
absorb all its assets.

free occupations at the time of receiving such income; whereas
it is obligatory on that portion of such income which remains
unexpended for a whole year.
3/1/4 Zakah is not obligatory on fixed assets which generate income
and  which  are  not  acquired  for  trade,  such  as  leased  assets.
Nevertheless, at the end of the year, Zakah is obligatory on the
remaining portion of the income generated by these assets.

3/2/4 Al-Hawl (Zakah year)
The  Zakah  year  for  cash  and  commercial  assets  as  well  as
livestock is a lunar year (354 days). In case of adopting the solar
year for cash and commercial assets, the Zakah rate becomes
2.577%.(2)(2) As regards agricultural products no consideration is
2.577%.
 As regards agricultural products no consideration is
to be given to the Hawl (Zakah year) because what matters is
harvesting. Similarly what should be considered for minerals
and Rikaz (treasures) is their extraction.
3/3  Applicable Zakah rate
  The rate of Zakah applicable to gold, silver, currencies and articles of
trade is 2.5% - with due consideration to item 3/2/3 above - , whereas
the  rate  applicable  to  agricultural  produce  is  one  tenth  (10%)  for
the  produce  of  non-irrigated  lands,  half  of  the  tenth  (5%)  for  the
produce  of  irrigated  lands,  and  three  quarters  of  the  tenth  (7.5%)
for the produce of partially irrigated lands. Zakah rates applicable to
livestock are shown at the end of this standard.
4. Fixed Assets

  Zakah is not obligatory on operational fixed assets such as the prem-
ises of the institution and its equipments; or on intangible assets such

as  patent  rights,  trademarks  and  computer  software.  Zakah  is  also
not obligatory on moveable assets acquired for operation (other than
those prepared for trade) such as spare parts and tools used for fur-
ther production, even when such assets are kept in the warehouses.
4/2  Income-generating fixed assets
  There  is  no  Zakah  on  fixed  assets  which  generate  income  like

 (leased assets), if such assets are not acquired for trade.
Mustghallat (leased assets), if such assets are not acquired for trade.
Nevertheless,  Zakah  is  obligatory,  at  the  end  of  the  year,  on  the
unexpended  portion  of  the  income  generated  by  such  assets,  by
adding  that  portion  of  income  to  the  other  zakatable  assets  and
applying the Zakah rate.
Income-earning fixed assets appear in the financial statements under
the following items:
4/2/1 Mustaghallat  (leased  assets  such  as  real  estate  properties,
transportation  vehicles..etc.).  At  the  end  of  the  year,  the
unexpended rental of these assets is to be subjected to Zakah
by adding it to other zakatable assets.
4/2/2 Real estate investments: At the end of the year, the unexpended
income of these assets is to be subjected to Zakah by adding it
to other zakatable assets.
4/2/3 Capital  projects  under  implementation  (which  are  not  for
trading)
If a project of this type happens to generate income at some of
its stages of implementation, Zakah is obligatory on the unex-
pended part of that income, after adding it to zakatable assets at
the end of the year. If such projects are being implemented for
trading purposes. [see item (5/2/6/3)]

If it is possible to know through the company what is the exact
amount of Zakatable assets (cash, articles of trade and repayable
debts) per share, Zakah can be levied on that amount, otherwise

875875
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
which has to be reached through estimation. If the company has
no zakatable assets, Zakah is obligatory on the remaining part
of the net income at the end of the year.
As far as shares owned for non-trading purposes are concerned,
no allocation for deterioration in the value of share investments
should  be  made  from  the  zakatable  assets.  Regarding  shares
acquired  for  trading  purposes,  the  ruling  on  articles  of  trade
(item 5/2) should be applied.
4/2/5 Investment in the shares of subsidiaries
In, accounting, a subsidiary is the entity in which the mother
company  owns  50%  of  the  shares.  The  process  of  Zakah
payment in this case starts with calculating the Zakah of the
subsidiary independently, and then the mother company pays
its  share  of  Zakah  in  proportion  to  its  shareholding  in  the
subsidiary. The remaining part of the Zakah of the subsidiary
is  to  be  paid  by  the  other  parties  (minority  rights).  Such
arrangement holds true when the subsidiary does not pay its
Zakah directly.(3)(3)
Zakah directly.
5. Zakatable Assets
5/1  Liquid or easy-to-liquidate current assets
  Such  assets  which  include  cash  assets  and  assets  which  can
be  converted  into  cash  (quasi  cash),  are  shown  in  the  financial
statements under the following items:
5/1/1 Cash in hand: Zakah has to be paid from these funds. If such
the
funds are in foreign currency Zakah should be paid from the
funds are in foreign currency Zakah should be paid from
equivalent  amount  in  local  currency  as  per  the  prevailing
exchange rate on the date when Zakah is due.
5/1/2 Gold and silver assets in any form: Zakah on such assets is to
be assessed on the basis of their net weight or cash value.
 From a Shariah point of view, the same ruling is applicable when the mother institution
(3)(3) From a Shariah point of view, the same ruling is applicable when the mother institution
owns less than 50% of the shares of the subsidiary.
876876
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
5/1/3 Bank balances: bank balances constitute the following items in
the financial statements:
5/1/3/1 Current accounts
Institutions  and  companies  should  pay  Zakah  from
their  current  accounts  with  other  Institutions,  be-
cause
such accounts constitute debts that will certainly
cause such accounts constitute debts that will certainly
be  settled.  Current  accounts  include  those  with  the
central bank as well as those with other banks. When
the  Institution  obtains  interest  in  such  accounts
(though it is prohibited) it should pay Zakah from the
principal amounts and donate the whole amount of
the interest for charitable purposes. For the banks or
the Institutions which receive such deposits current
accounts constitute liabilities. [see item 6/3/1]
5/1/3/2 Investment accounts
a)  The  owners  of  these  accounts  should  pay  Zakah
from the investment balances as well as the profits,
whether such accounts represent short or long term
deposits, and even if drawing from the account is
restricted  by  the  investment  Institution  or  the
owner. If these accounts are invested through per-
missible modes, what really matters is their share in
the investment assets, rather than their share in the
invested amounts. Consequently due consideration
has to be given to the nature of the assets represen-
ting the invested amounts.
As  for  the  institutions  in  which  the  accounts  are
invested,  an  account  of  this  type  represents  a  trust
(Amanah) rather than a liability, and therefore these
Institutions should pay Zakah only on their share of
the profits or their commissions, as part of their cash
assets.
877877
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
b)  When the investment accounts earn interests (though
prohibited) Zakah is payable from the principal, while
the entire amount of interest should be donated for
charitable purposes. As for the banks in which these
interest bearing accounts are deposited, the principal
amounts  (excluding  interest)  represent  liabilities.
[see item 6/3/2]
5/1/4 Bonds, Sukuk and funds
5/1/4/1 Bonds  and  treasury  bills  (which  represent  debts  and
involve  interest    though  prohibited):  Zakah  from
the  principal  of  the  bond  (cost  of  the  bond)  should
be paid, whereas the entire amount of interest should
be  donated  for  charitable  purposes.  As  regards  the
issuing banks, the nominal value of these bonds and
bills represent a liability. [see item 6/3/2]
5/1/4/2 Investment  Sukuk  of  different  types:  Their  owners
should pay Zakah on the basis of the underlying assets
of these Sukuk, and as indicated in this Standard. As
for  the  Institutions  which  manage  the  assets  or  keep
the  investment  Sukuk,  the  Sukuk  represent  a  trust
(Amanah)  rather  than  a  liability,  and  therefore  these
Institutions  should  pay  Zakah  only  on  their  share  of
the profits or their commissions, as part of their cash
assets.
5/1/4/3 Investment Funds in their different forms: Zakah has
to be paid on the basis of the underlying assets of the
fund, and as indicated in this Standard.
5/1/5 Amounts retained for documentation of the deal
5/1/5/1 Hamish  Jiddiyyah
5/1/5/1
(security  deposit):  This  refers  to
Hamish  Jiddiyyah  (security  deposit):  This  refers  to
the advance amount which the client pays in order to
confirm his binding pledge. Such amount is supposed
to  cover  any  harm  caused  by  recoiling  of  the  client
from completion of the deal: Zakah on such amount
878878
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
shall be paid by the
client. If the amount is deposited
shall be paid by the client. If the amount is deposited
in  a  current  account  it  shall  become  subject  to  the
rulings shown in item 5/7/3/1 and if it is deposited in
an investment account it shall become subject to the
rulings indicated in item. [5/1/3/2]
5/1/5/2 The initial security for entering bids as well as imple-
mentation security: are to be ducted from the zakatable
assets of the Institution which receives them, while the
owner  of  such  amount  has  to  pay  Zakah  it  annually
as part of his assets, unless he has not been enabled to
invest it before refund. When several years elapse be-
fore refund, Zakah for one year has to be paid. If such
amounts  are  deposited  in  an  investment  account  it
shall become subject to the rulings stipulated in item.
[5/1/3/2]
5/1/5/3 Cash security charged to individuals and Institutions
for  obtaining  certain  services  such  as  telephone  and
electricity services, or security paid on renting shops
and equipments: Zakah should be paid by the owner
of such amount on refund, and for one year, unless he
has been enabled to invest the amount before refund.
If the owner of the amount has been enabled to invest
it  before  refund  Zakah  has  to  be  paid  subject  to  the
rulings stated in item. [5/1/5/2]
5/1/5/4 Arboun  (Earnest  Money):  To  be  deducted  from  the
zakatable assets of the buyer, while the seller should
pay Zakah from it as part of his Zakatable assets, since
he will get the amount if the contract is concluded or
not.not.
5/2  Commodity current assets (Articles of Trade)
5/2/1 Articles of trade include anything offered for sale such as real
estate and moveable assets, whether the good is being sold in
879879
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
its current state or after manufacturing, and when it is acquired
through buying or otherwise. To be subject to Zakah payment
such goods should not necessarily be obtained through buying,
the mere intention to offer them for sale is quite sufficient.
5/2/2 Articles of trade should be valued at selling market price in the
place where they exist, and according to the method of their sale
(retail, or wholesale, or if both whichever the predominant).
Articles of trade should not be valued at cost or market price
whichever the less. However, when other methods of valuation
are extremely difficult, valuation at cost can be used for Zakah
purposes.  When  there  is  a  price  change  during  the  period
between the date of accrual and date of payment of Zakah, the
price at the date of Zakah accrual should be adopted.
5/2/3 When the articles of trade are subject to another type of Zakah
treatment  (e.g.,  when  the  articles  of  trade  are  livestock  or
agricultural  produce)  they  should  become  subject  to  Zakah
on articles of trade only.
5/2/4 In principle, Zakah on articles of trade is to be paid in cash, yet
in case of trade recession it can be paid in kind (from the same
articles of trade), provided that the interest of Zakah recipients
could, thus, be achieved.
5/2/5 Zakah has to be paid on the goods earmarked for the buyer
after concluding the contract, even if he has not yet possessed
them.
5/2/6 Applications relating to commodity current assets in the items
of financial statements
5/2/6/1 Commodity stocks prepared for Trade, raw materials
in  their  different  forms,  and  goods  for  sale  in  their
original form or after being manufactured by adding
them to other materials: To be valued for Zakah pur-
poses at selling market price.
880880
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
If a good of this type is defective it shall be valued at
its selling market price and as per the method of its
sale (retail, or wholesale, or if both whichever the pre-
dominant). If the good in question is a slow-moving
item it can be valued for Zakah at its market price and
in  its  current  form.  When  an  allocation  is  made  for
such goods it should not be deducted from zakatable
assets.
5/2/6/2 Goods  in  process:  To  be  valued  for  Zakah  at  their
current market price on the day of Zakah accrual, and
if  it  is  not  possible  to  know  their  market  value,  they
could be valued at cost.
5/2/6/3 Works  under  implementation  (constructions):  To  be
valued for Zakah in their current state on the day of
Zakah accrual.
5/2/6/4 Industrial accessories (spare parts) used in production
equipment: are not part of Zakatable assets.
5/2/6/5 Goods in transit: To be valued for Zakah at market price
in the place where they are found.
5/2/6/6 Goods to be sold by others on commission (by agency):
To  be  valued  for  Zakah  at  market  price  in  the  place
where they are found.
5/2/6/7 Goods imported through documentary credits covered
by the Institution, including the expenses of opening
the credit and the amounts retained by intermediary
banks: Zakah should be paid on the amounts retained
for the credit, and not the expenses. When the goods
are  owned  Zakah  has  to  be  paid  from  them  on  the
basis of their market value.
5/2/6/8 Goods prepared for export through documentary cred-
retained
its to the benefit of the Institution: The amounts retained
its to the benefit of the Institution: The amounts
881881
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
for the credit, are neither subject to Zakah nor are they
deductable from zakatable assets, since they have not yet
been possessed. However, Zakah has to be paid on the
goods that are still held by the Institution as part of its
finished goods or goods in process.
5/2/7 Intangible rights prepared for trade such as copy right, patent
right, trademarks, and computer software: should be subject
to Zakah on articles of trade.
5/2/8 End  of  the  year  stock  of  raw  materials  (primary  materials)
which are normally used as ingredients and remain as compo-
nents of the goods manufactured for trade: Should be valued
for Zakah at their market value before entering the process of
manufacturing. No Zakah is payable on supporting materials
which do not represent ingredients of or remain as compo-
nents of the manufactured goods, such as fuel and cleaning
materials.
5/2/9  Finished  goods  and  goods  in  process  being  manufactured  for
trade: are subject to the same rate applicable to Zakah on articles
of trade. Finished goods and goods in process should be valued
in their current state and at market price.
5/2/10 Rapping  and  packing  materials:  are  not  to  be  included  in
valuation of goods for Zakah if such materials are not prepared
for  trade  separately.  Nevertheless,  if  such  materials  increase
the value of the goods they should be included.
5/3  Receivables of the institution or the company
5/3/1 If the debt owed to the Institution is a cash amount the Institu-
tion should pay Zakah on it annually - whether such debt is due
or not - since the Institution will certainly receive it. As for bad
debts (non-repayable debts) and doubtful debts the Institution
does not have to pay Zakah except for one year after collection
of such debts, and as per the rulings indicated in item 6/2.
882882
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
5/3/2 The institution can postpone Zakah on its outstanding debts
until full or partial collection. On collection, the Institution has
to pay Zakah for the whole past period. When a specific debt
is  partially  doubtful,  and  an  allocation  is  made  for  doubtful
debts,  the  doubtful  part  of  the  debt  can  be  deducted  from
Zakatable assets, if the total amount of such debt has initially
been included in the these assets.
5/3/3 When the debt owed to the institution by another party com-
prises interest that has arisen from the process of lending and
borrowing  or  from  rescheduling  of  the  debt;  the  Institution
should pay Zakah on the principal only and donate the whole
amount of interest for charitable purposes. It should, howev-
er, be noted that interest bearing deposits and loans as well as
discounting of receipt papers are strictly prohibited dealings
which should be avoided.
5/3/4 Applications relating to Receivables in the items of financial
statements
5/3/4/1 Debtors: Zakah shall be paid on the amounts payable to
the Institution against goods or services sold on debt.
In this respect, due consideration should be given to the
above-mentioned items.
5/3/4/2 Loans, overdraft accounts, and debt bonds including
discounted  bonds  (zero  coupon)  and  accepted  bills
(discounted bills): Zakah is payable on the value paid
for  purchasing  the  bond,  whereas  interest    though
prohibited    should  become  subject  to  the  rulings
indicated in item 5/3/4.
5/3/4/3 Receipt  papers  (bills  and  promissory  notes):  Zakah
shall be paid on the principal of the debt (amount of the
paper), including the increment added to the price, if
the paper relates to a commodity sold on debt. It shall be
noted here that the case will remain the same whether
883883
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
the debt represented by the paper is due or not, since no
difficulty  is  going  to  be  encountered  in  its  collection.
If the paper comprises interest the rulings indicted in
item 5/3/4 regarding interest should be observed.
5/3/4/4 Amounts  retained  from  contracts:  Such  guarantee
amounts  are  held  by  the  clients  to  ensure  that  the
Institution is going to honor its commitments. If the
Institution  has  not  been  enabled  to  invest  these  re-
tention  amounts  it  should  not  pay  Zakah  on  them.
However,  on  receipt  of  the  amounts  the  Institution
has to pay Zakah on them for only one year.
5/3/4/5 Advance  payments  on  signing  contracts:  No  Zakah
shall be paid on them, since they are no longer owned
by the Institution.
5/3/4/6 Prepaid expenses: No Zakah is payable on such amounts
which represent expenses of forthcoming financial pe-
riods, since they are no longer owned by the Institution.
5/3/4/7 Accrued income: It represents income of the current
period which has not yet been received, and it shall be
subject to Zakah on debts as indicated in item 5/3/1.
5/3/4/8 Legal deposit: It refers to the amount retained by a bank
on  request  of  the  concerned  authorities  for  the  sake
of awarding license to the Institution. The Institution
cannot  withdraw  or  dispose  of  such  amount  except
on  permission  of  the  concerned  authorities.  If  the
institution has not been enabled to invest the retained
amount  it  shall  pay  Zakah  on  it  for  only  one  year  at
the  time  of  refund.  If  such  deposit  involves  interest
(though prohibited) the rulings indicated in item 5/3/4
should be applied.
5/3/4/9 Murabahah debtors: It indicates the amounts owed by
purchasers. Zakah in this case is payable on total price
including profits, as indicated in item 5/3/1.
884884
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
5/3/4/10 Debtors of Salam goods purchased by the Institution
and not yet received: the Institution should pay Zakah
on Salam capital if the goods have been purchased for
trading purposes. When the goods are purchased for
operating or income generating purposes the rulings
indicated  in  item  4/1  and  4/2  should  be  applied.  As
regards the Salam capital received by the seller of the
goods, such income is subject to Zakah as part of the
sellers cash assets.
5/3/4/11 Debtors of Istisnaa goods sold by the institution: This
item represents the balance of amounts due to the Insti-
tution as per delivery dates of the Istisnaa commodity.
Such amounts are part of Zakatable assets, and Zakah
has to be paid on them under the category of current
assets, because they constitute cash amounts.
5/3/4/12 Debtors of Istisnaa goods purchased by the institution:
When such goods are purchased for the sake of trading,
the debt relating to them (the price which the Institution
is  committed  to  pay  to  the  seller)  should  be  included
in zakatable assets, and subjected to Zakah as per item
5/3/1.
5/3/4/13 Investment  in  shares  for  the  sake  of  trading:  Should
become subject to the Zakah rate applicable to articles
for trade. Valuation has to be at market price, yet in the
absence of any market for such shares, valuation can
be made by experts.
5/3/5 Debtors in an insurance portfolio
As indicated in the Shariah standard on Islamic Insurance the
contributions of policyholders constitute a fund which has an
independent financial liability, and the contributor is supposed
to have given the premium as a donation. Consequently, the in-
surance fund is not committed to pay back any excess amounts
to policyholders [items 2 and 5/5 of the Shariah Standard No.
885885
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
(26) on Islamic Insurance]. In view of this no Zakah is payable
by the insurance portfolio.
5/4  Zakah on agricultural produce and fruits

half of the tenth (5%) for the produce of irrigated lands, and
three quarters of the tenth (7.5%) for the produce of partially
irrigated lands.

dies shall be included in the Zakah base as part of liquid assets
subject to item 5/3/1, whereas free-of-charge land and equip-
ment should not.

The Zakah rate applicable to minerals is 2.5%. If the extracted
minerals are owned by the state no Zakah shall be paid on them,
otherwise  minerals  are  the  property  of  their  extractor,  and  he
should pay Zakah on them. [see Shariah Standard No. (22) on
Concession Contracts]
5/5/3 Pearl,  coral  and  fish  extracted  from  the  sea  for  trade  should
become subject to the Zakah rate applicable to articles of trade.

shown at the end of this standard. Livestock that reaches the NisabNisab is
subject to Zakah, whether owned for milk or progeny. The animals
shall become subject to the Zakah rate on livestock, only if they are
fed through free grazing, most of the year. If the animals are owned
for trade they shall become subject to the Zakah rate on articles of
trade.
887887
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
5/6/1 It makes no difference if the animals which belong to the same
owner are found in the same place or different places. Mixed
ownership can also be recognized so that the animals owned
by more than one person are treated as if they are owned by
a single person, when such animals share the same facilities.
5/6/2 Animals owned for trade should become subject to the Zakah
rate on articles of trade. Valuation has to be at selling market
price.
5/6/3 Working animals, such as animals used in land plowing, irri-
gation and carrying are not part of zakatable assets.
5/6/4  Animals  other  than  camels,  cows  and  goats  are  not  subject  to
Zakah payment, unless they are owned for trade. If such animals
are  used  for  production  rather  than  trade  they  should  not  be
included in zakatable assets.
5/6/5 When animal products such as milk and wool are owned for
trade they should become subject to Zakah on articles of trade.
5/6/6 Zakah is not payable on horses, mules, donkeys and all other
animals used for work or adornment, unless owned for trade.
5/6/7 Zakah is not obligatory on chickens acquired for production,
which  should  be  treated  in  the  same  way  as  Mustaghallat
(productive assets such as leased properties). [see item 4/2]
5/6/8 Chickens, milk and stocks of animals are subject to Zakah on
articles of trade when they are owned for trade purposes.
6. Liabilities
6/1  Classification of liabilities
  Liabilities  in  financial  statements  comprise  items  which  are  not
debts owed by the Institution in the strict sense of Shariah. Such
items include for instance the capital of the company, the reserves
and  the  profits.  The  debts  included  under  the  item  of  liabilities
comprise the following:
888888
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
6/1/1 Non-current  (long  term)  liabilities  which  refer  to  debts  that
become due after one year. Such debts usually arise from pur-
chase of fixed assets on debt, in addition to other long term
entitlements.
6/1/2 Current (short term) liabilities which refer to debts that become
due within one year.
6/2  Debts owed by the institution
6/2/1 If the debts owed by the Institution have arisen from obtaining
current zakatable assets for the purpose of trade they should
be deducted from the Zakah base.
6/2/2 If the debts owed by the Institution have arisen from obtaining
non-zakatable fixed assets, they should not be deducted from
the Zakah base.
6/2/3 When it is difficult to know the amount of debt that has arisen
from acquiring zakatable assets, the ratio of zakatable assets to
total assets should be used for assessment of such debt which
has  to  be  deducted  from  the  Zakah  base.  If,  for  instance,
zakatable  assets  constitute  40%  of  total  assets,  40%  of  total
debts should be deducted from the Zakah base.
6/2/4  If the debt owed by the Institution has arisen from a Shariah-
banned  practice  such  as  borrowing  with  interest,  unpaid  in-
terests  should  not  be  deducted  from  zakatable  assets,  because
impermissible commitments cannot lead to a Shariah-recogniz-
able debt.
6/3  Applications relating to current liabilities in the items of financial
statements
6/3/1 Current  accounts:  The  balances  of  current  accounts  should
be deducted from the zakatable assets of the Institutions with
which such accounts are deposited. Similarly, the principal as
well as the profits of investment accounts should be deducted
from  the  zakatable  assets  of  the  Institutions  entrusted  with
889889
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
investing  these  accounts  to  the  benefit  of  their  holders.  In
the case of investment accounts the share of the Mudarib or
agency fees earned by the Institution shall  be excluded from
the deductable amount.
6/3/2  Creditors: This item refers to the amounts payable to the creditors
of the institution during the Zakah year. Such amounts which
usually arise from obtaining goods, equipment, or services on
debt should be deducted from zakatable assets.
6/3/3 Creditors of sold goods of Salam: It refers to those who pur-
chased  goods  from  the  Institution  through  Salam  and  have
not  yet  received  them.  The  goods  constitute  a  debt,  because
they have not yet been delivered, and therefore, the amount of
Salam capital should be deducted from the zakatable assets.
6/3/4 Creditors of sold goods of Istisnaa: The goods constitute a debt
because the Institution has entered in a commitment to make
them, and it is yet to do so. Hence, such goods shall become
subject to the rulings indicated in item 6/3/6.
6/3/5 Creditors  of  purchased  goods  of  Istisnaa:  This  indicates  the
debt commitment of the Institution when it purchases goods
through Istisnaa. The balance of this item should be deducted
from Zakatable assets.
6/3/6 Payment  papers:  It  includes  bills  and  order  bonds  issued  to
importers  of  deferred  goods  and  services,  or  bills  and  order
bonds  issued  for  interest  free  borrowing;  if  such  papers  will
fall due in the next Zakah year. Such assets should be deducted
from zakatable assets.
6/3/7 Short term loans and overdraft accounts shall be subject to the
rulings indicated in item 6/3/2.
6/3/8 Accrued expenses: It is the expenses which relate to the current
period and is to be paid during the next period. Such expenses
should be deducted from zakatable assets.
890890
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
6/3/9 Prepaid income: If such income relates to services which have
not  yet  been  provided  no  Zakah  has  to  be  paid  on  the  exact
portion of it which relates to the undelivered services; because
such income is not finally owned, and the Ijarah (hiring) contract
for provision of the services could be terminated on occurrence
of an excuse or a
 situation. Consequently prepaid
force majeure situation. Consequently prepaid
of an excuse or a force majeure
income  for  undelivered  services  should  be  deducted  from
zakatable assets.
Nevertheless,  cash  amounts  of
forwarded  on
earnest  money  forwarded  on
Nevertheless,  cash  amounts  of  earnest  money
conclusion of written or verbal exchange-based (Muawadah)
contracts  are  considered  to  be  owned  by  the  Institution  or
the company, and Zakah has to be paid on them even if the
goods in question have not been delivered. That is to say such
amounts should not be deducted from zakatable assets.
6/3/10 Due taxes: Tax amounts that relate to the current period, but
has  to  be  paid  in  the  next  period  should  be  deducted  from
zakatable assets.
6/3/11 Security amounts paid by clients to guarantee fulfillments of
their commitments and settlement of periodical bills should
be deducted from zakatable assets.
6/3/12 Minority  rights  which  refer  to  other  shareholders  equity  in
the subsidiary, and which appear in the consolidated financial
statements should become subject to the rulings indicated in
item 4/2/5.
7. Provisions
7/1  Definition of provisions
  Provisions represent the amounts retained from revenues at the end
of the financial period so as to cater for probable shortage of assets, or
to meet imprecisely determined or unforeseen commitments of the
Institution. Since provisions are estimates of probable loss amounts
and  unspecified  commitments,  they  have  to  be  totally  or  partially
returned back to the profit and loss account (income statement), if
891891
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
the debt is collected or the commitment is fulfilled, or if the provision
amount is more than it should have been.
7/2  Classification of provisions
  Regarding provisions, the following should be observed:
7/2/1 Provisions relating to fixed assets: Such provisions are nonde-
ductible from Zakah assets, since fixed assets are not part of
the Zakah base.
7/2/2 Provisions relating to current assets: Since Zakah is calculable
on  the  basis  of  market  value,  provisions  relating  to  current
assets are not considered as part of liabilities to be deducted
from  zakatable  assets.  If,  for  any  reason,  current  assets  are
valued for Zakah calculation at book value which happens to
be  more  than  exchange  value,  the  difference  between  book
value  and  market  value  pertinent  to  provisions  should  be
deducted from Zakatable assets.
7/2/3 Provisions  relating  to  liabilities:  Liability  provisions  which
aim  to  cover  imprecisely  determined  commitments  of  the
company such as provisions for: end of service benefits, staff
leaves,  taxation,  and  indemnities,  shall  be  reasonable  so  as
not  to  become  secret  reserves.  Whenever  exaggeration  in
such provisions is discovered, the excess amount should be
removed.
7/2/4 In  the  cases  when  the  provision  is  deductable  from  assets
interest should not be deducted if it happens to be involved
in it. Deduction from assets in this case should include only
the  Shariah-recognizable  commitment.  It  should,  however,
be noted that interest bearing deposits and loans are strictly
prohibited by Shariah. [see item 6/2/3]
7/3  Applications relating to provisions
7/3/1 Provision  for  redemption  of  pre-operating  expenses:  It  is  the
cumulative amount of the redeemed part of pre-operating ex-
penses. This provision is not deductable from zakatable assets.
892892
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
7/3/2 Provision for deterioration in the value of investments in shares
purchased for acquisition: This provision is meant to cater for
price decline in financial markets, or book value, below cost;
in case of valuation at cost or market value whichever the less.
Such provision is not deductable from zakatable assets.
7/3/3 Provision for perishable or slow moving goods: In case of slow
moving goods the provision is to cover probable declines in
value due to expiry, obsolescence of type, or slow marketing.
This provision is not deductable from zakatable assets.
7/3/4  Provision for probable declines in the prices of goods or financial
papers: This provision is usually made to cater for declines which
actually take place, and it is not deductable from Zakatable assets.
7/3/5 Provision for leaves: It is the amount deducted from revenues so
as to cater for the commitment of the institution to compensate
staff  for  leave  entitlements.  This  provision  is  not  deductable
from Zakatable assets.
7/3/6 Provision for end of service and retirement benefits or pension
salary of staff: It refers to the amounts deducted from revenues
for meeting payment of such obligations. Such amounts are not
deductable  from  Zakatable  assets  because  they  are  allocated
for disbursement, but not yet disbursed. They can be deducted
only when they are actually paid or when they become due for
payment during the current year, but not yet settled.
7/3/7 Provision for indemnity: It refers to the estimated amounts
deducted  from  revenues  in  order  to  cater  for  a  confirmed
commitment relating to an initial legal verdict (before appeal)
stipulating  the  payment  of  a  specific  amount  as  indemnity
to a certain party. Such provision is estimated according to
the  amounts  mentioned  in  the  verdict,  and  it  should  not
be deducted from Zakatable assets until it becomes due for
payment by virtue of a final verdict.
7/3/8 Provision for maintenance: It is an amount allocated for spend-
ing, but not yet spent. It is not deductable from Zakatable assets.
893893
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
7/3/9 Provision for insurance of fixed assets: This provision refers to
the amounts charged to the revenues of the company to sub-
stitute the premiums that will be paid to insurance companies.
This provision is estimated as per the amounts of its compo-
nents. It should not be deducted from Zakatable assets because
it comprises amounts that have been allocated for spending,
but still owned by the company.
7/3/10  Provision for decrease in the price of currencies: It is the amount
charged to the revenues of the company to cater for probable
decline of the prices of foreign currencies against the price of
the currency used in the financial statements of the company.
It  is  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  difference  between  the  two
prices (purchase price and market price). Such provision is not
deductable from zakatable assets, because what matters is the
prevailing exchange price at the time of valuation of Zakatable
assets.
7/3/11 Provision for taxes: It refers to the estimated amounts deducted
from the revenues of the company for settlement of the unpaid
taxes of the current year. Such provision is assessed according
to size of activity during the current financial period, besides
the tax level in the previous financial periods. This provision
is not deductable from Zakatable assets.
8. Reserves
8/1  Definition of reserves
  Reserves are amounts deducted from profits by virtue of law (statutory
reserves), or as required by articles of association of the Institution, or
on the basis of a decision by the general assembly (voluntary reserves).
Reserves  provide  necessary  funds  for  many  purposes  such  as  future
expansion, facing probable losses, distribution of profits in the years
when  no  profits  are  realized,  and  distribution  of  the  accumulated
amounts of the reserves when they are no longer needed.
894894
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
8/2  Nature and Shariah status (Hukm) of reserves
8/2/1 Both  types  of  reserves  (statutory  and  voluntary)  are  not
deductable  from  zakatable  assets,  because  in  Shariah  they
are  not  considered  to  constitute  debt  obligations  owed  by
the company, although it is referred to under liabilities. Since
reserves are owned by the company they should be subject to
Zakah as part of Zakatable assets, in case of applying the net
assets method of Zakah assessment.
8/2/2 In  spite  of  the fact  that the  capital account and  the  issuance
8/2/2 In  spite  of  the fact  that  the capital  account and  the issuance
premium  provide  sources  of  funding  for  the  company  they
are  not  considered  to  be  part  of  its  debt  obligations,  even  if
capital is usually referred to under liabilities. Therefore, capi-
tal
account and issuance premium are not deductable from
tal account and issuance premium are not deductable from
Zakatable assets.
8/3  Applications relating to reserves
8/3/1  Revaluation reserve (capital reserves): It results from revaluation
of  fixed  assets  at  current  market  value,  and  since  fixed  assets
are  not  subject  to  Zakah,  such  reserve  is  not  deductable  from
Zakatable assets.
8/3/2 Income  reserve:  It  refers  to  that  part  of  distributable  profit
which is retained by an administrative decision in provision for
future need. It is not a debt obligation owed by the Institution,
and therefore should not be deducted from Zakatable assets.
8/3/3 Reserve  of  profits  earned  from  share  purchasing  operation
(institutions treasury shares): This reserve results from the act
of the Institution when it purchases and sells its own shares. It
is not deductable from Zakatable assets, since it is part of the
profits.
8/3/4 Reserve  of  profits  declared  for  distribution:  It  refers  to  the
profit declared by the board of directors, but the decision for
its distribution has not yet been taken.
895895
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
8/3/5 Reserve of retained profits: This reserve comprises the profits
earmarked for transference to forthcoming years. It constitutes
one  type  of  income  reserves,  and  is  not  deductable  from
assets.
Zakatable assets.

9. Eight Heads of Zakah Disbursement
  The  heads  of  Zakah  disbursement  are  the  eight  categories  specified
(As-Sadaqat  (here  it  means  Zakat)  are
by  the  Verse  which  states:  (As-Sadaqat  (here  it  means  Zakat)  are
by  the  Verse  which  states:
only  for  the  Fuqara  (poor),  and  Al-Masakin  (the  poor)  and  those
employed to collect (the funds); and for to attract the hearts of those
who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and
for those in debt; and for Allahs Cause (i.e., for Mujahidun - those
fighting  in  the  holy  wars),  and  for  the  wayfarer  (a  traveller  who  is
cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-
Knower, All-Wise.)(4)(4) Shariah Supervisory Boards of the institutions
Knower, All-Wise.)
 Shariah Supervisory Boards of the institutions
may specify the meaning and appropriate way of application, for each
one of these categories.
10. Rulings Relating to Zakah Disbursement
10/1  The  Zakah  payer  (institution)  cannot  discharge  of  his  Zakah
commitment by relieving his debtors from their debt obligations.
This, however, does not mean that Zakah recipients cannot repay
their  debts  out  of  the  Zakah  amounts  which  they  receive  from
their creditors, provided that such arrangement does not involve
collusion or a pre-stated condition.
10/2  In principle, Zakah is to be paid as soon as it is due, yet it can be
delayed - for not more than one year  due to shortage of funds,
or if its distribution is made according to a certain time schedule,
or for any other obvious interest.
10/3  Institutions should establish a special fund or account for Zakah.
10/4 In  principle,  Zakah  should  be  spent  on  its  eight  heads,  yet  if
need arises Zakah funds can be utilized in investment projects.
 [Al-Tawbah (Repentance): 60]
(4)(4) [Al-Tawbah (Repentance): 60]
896896
Shariah Standard No. (35): Zakah
However,  such  projects  should,  at  the  end,  be  owned  by  the
Zakah recipients, or put under the supervision of the competent
Shariah  body  entrusted  with  collection  and  distribution  of
Zakah. Nevertheless, investment of Zakah funds should be after

place due to an obvious interest to be judged by the Shariah boards
of the institutions.

IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MOST MERCIFUL
All praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, and blessings and peace be
upon our master, Muhammad, and his household and all his companions
Preface
This Standard aims to illustrate the contingent incidents which come
suddenly upon commitments and cause deviation from stipulated results.
909909
Shariah Standard No. (36): Impact of Contingent Incidents on Commitments
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers the contingent incidents encountered in honoring
the  commitments  that  stem  from  application  of  Islamic  modes  of
financing and investment by Islamic financial institutions (Institution/
Institutions).(1)(1) It also covers the effects of such incidents on commitments.
 It also covers the effects of such incidents on commitments.
Institutions).
  The Standard, however, does not cover defects of will or the conducts
that result from mutual consent of the two parties.
2. Definition of Contingent Incidents
  Contingent  incidents  in  this  standard  refer  to  those  incidents  which
occur  suddenly  and  cause  significant  influence  on  commitments  that
are  properly  stipulated.  Therefore,  contingent  incidents  are  different
from defects of will, which exist since the time of signing the contract,
although  their  impact  occurs  later  on.  Contingent  incidents  are  also
different  from  termination  of  commitments  on  mutual  consent  of  the
two parties or as per the desire of any of them; when a party is entitled to
such right by virtue of the contract.
3. Types of Contingent Incidents
  From the standpoint of its influence, a contingent incident can be either
of  the  type  that  necessitates  amendments  in  the  contract,  or  the  type
which constitutes an external reason for termination of the contract.
4. Contingencies Leading to Amendment of the Contract
  The impact of such contingencies is confined to necessitating amendments
in the contract rather than leading to its complete termination. Practical
examples of such contingencies include the following among others:
 The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
(1)(1) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial
institutions including Islamic Banks.
910910
Shariah Standard No. (36): Impact of Contingent Incidents on Commitments
4/1  Levy of custom duties or taxes after signing the contract. Such inci-
dent affects the commitment of the party who has to bear the new
obligations by virtue of law or as per the stipulations of the contract.
4/2  Change  in  the  prices  of  the  commodities  used  in  implementation
of a contract in a way that subjects the contractor to serious harm.
Actual  harm  in  this  case  can  be  removed  through  reconciliation,
arbitration or legal arrangements.
4/3  Prevention of importation of the goods to be delivered in fulfillment of
a Murabahah or Ijarah contract. The actual harm caused to the client or
the Institution can, in this case, be removed by resort to reconciliation,
arbitration or law.
4/4  Change in laws leading to more financial commitments to be borne
by one of the two parties. Determination of the party who shall bear
the additional burden can be reached by resort to law or as per the
stipulations of the contract.
5. Contingencies  Which  Constitute  External  Reasons  for  Termination
of the Contract
  This type of contingencies leads to termination of commitments without
intervention of any of the two parties. Bearing of the consequences in
this case is to be assigned to the competent party, as when an owner has
to  bear  the  consequences  relating  to  what  he  owns.  Examples  of  such
contingencies include, among others:
5/1  When delivery becomes impossible or useless
In this case the fulfillment of the commitment becomes impossible
or of no use; as when the commitment to supply the requirements of
a conference could not be fulfilled before holding the conference. In
such case the commitment shall become null and void if:
5/1/1 Failure to honor the commitment is absolutely inevitable.
5/1/2 Failure  to  honor  the  commitment  originates  from  objective
rather than personal reasons.
5/1/3  Failure to honor the commitment is caused by an external party.
911911
Shariah Standard No. (36): Impact of Contingent Incidents on Commitments
5/2  Total or partial damage of the object of commitment
If the object of commitment is damaged before being delivered to the
committing party, the loss should be borne by the committed party.
Similarly,  when  the  commitment  object  is  completely  damaged  due
to an act of the committing party, that party should bear the loss. In
case of partial damage of the object of commitment before actual or
legal delivery to the committing party, and if the damage is caused by
a heavenly factor (Sabab Samawi) which the committed partly can by
no means avoid, the committing party should have the right of option.
5/3  Entitlement to the object of commitment
If the object of commitment turned out to be owned by someone else
other the committed party, the committing party becomes entitled
to  compensation.  If  the  object  of  commitment  is  partly  owned  by
someone else the commitment in that part becomes null and void,
and the committing party shall have the right of option with regard
to  accepting  or  declining  the  remaining  part  of  the  commitment
object. The committing party may choose to accept the remaining
part as part of his compensation or he may terminate the contract
due to fragmentation of delivery.
5/4  Termination of commitment due to excuses
  When  the  emergence  of  an  incidental  excuse  in  Ijarah  leads  to
abnormal  harm,  the  harmed  party  has  the  right  to  terminate  the
contract. The party who encounters the incident may also terminate
the contract if his excuse is obvious. If acceptability of the excuse is
doubtful the issue may be resolved by mutual agreement, or resort
to law. [see Shariah Standard No. (9) on Ijarah or Ijarah Muntahiah
Bittamleek; and Shariah Standard No. (34) on Hiring of Persons]
5/5  Jawa`ih (calamities)
  The term Jawa`ih refers to any incident (other than human acts) which
cannot be avoided even if known. The effects of such incidents are 
originally - noticeable in selling of fruits and other agricultural products,
discounting the

price in proportion to the damage in the product. An example of this
can also be seen in the Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek Contract. In this
case the amount of rent in excess of the normal rent of similar property
is  dropped  when  ownership  cannot  be  transferred  to  the  lessor  for
a reason which the lessee cannot stop. [see Shariah Standard No. (9) on
Ijarah or Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, item 8/8]

Commitments.
On 29 Jumada I, 1426 A.H., corresponding to 6 July 2005 A.D., the Shariah
Standards Committee decided to commission a consultant to prepare a study
on Impact of Contingent Incidents on Commitments.
The  study  was  discussed  in  a  joint  meeting  of  the  Shariah  Standards
Committees (1) and (2), held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 89 Rabi I,

advised the consultant to introduce the necessary changes in the Standard,
in the light of the discussions and observations of the meeting.
The revised draft of the Standard was discussed in another joint meeting
of the Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2), held in the Kingdom of
Bahrain, on Thursday 21 Shaban 1427 A.H., corresponding to 14 September
2006  A.D.  The  consultant  was  again  advised  to  introduce  changes  in  the
Standard as per the discussions and observations of the meeting.
In its meeting No. (20) held in the Kingdom of Bahrain, on 4-8 Safar
1429 A.H., corresponding to 11-15 February 2008 A.D., the Shariah Board
discussed the Changes in the Standard which had been made by the joint
meeting  of  Shariah  Standards  Committees  (1)  and  (2),  and  introduced
changes that it deemed necessary.
The Secretarial General of AAOIFI held a public hearing in the Kingdom
of Bahrain on 24 Safar 1430 A.H., corresponding to 19 February 2009 A.D.

More than 30 participants attended the session as representatives of central
banks, Institutions, and accounting firms. The session was also attended by
Shariah scholars, university teachers and other interested parties. Several
observations  were  made  in  the  session,  and  duly  responded  to  by  the
members of the Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2).

 Saturday 15-17 Rabi I, 1430 A.H., corresponding to 12-15 March 2009
A.D., the Shariah Board discussed the amendments that had been suggested
in  the  public  hearing,  introduced  changes  that  it  deemed  necessary  and
adopted the Standard.

Shariah Standard No. (36): Impact of Contingent Incidents on Commitments
Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  Permissibility  of  amending  the  commitment  to  absorb  the  impacts  of
Permissibility  of  amending  the  commitment  to  absorb  the  impacts  of
contingent  incidents  is  based  on  the  fact  that  in  such  cases  Muslims
should strive for appropriate disposition without rushing to termination
of the commitment. This rule is adopted by the various schools of Fiqh
with regard to external incidents which take place without the interven-
tion of any of the two parties.
  The ruling that the commitment shall become null and void if its ful-
The ruling that the commitment shall become null and void if its ful-
fillment has become useless is based on the fact that implementation
of a useless commitment is an act of futility, while there is no room
for futility in Shariah legislation as indicated by Al-Shatibi and others.
The basis for the ruling that commitment shall become ineffective when
  The basis for the ruling that commitment shall become ineffective when
the object of the contract turns out to be owned by someone else other
than  the  committed  party,  is  that  unlawful  seizure  is  unrecognizable  as
a basis of ownership. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have

Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  credit  facilities  and  the  returns  and  commissions
arising  from  them,  whether  such  facilities  are  practiced  between  the
Institution and its clients or between the institution and other institutions.
2. Definition of Credit Facilities
2/1  The term credit refers to the financial transaction according to which
one of the two parties becomes indebted to the other. Indebtedness
in  such  transactions can  arise  at  the  beginning of  the  transaction,
in  such  transactions  can  arise  at  the  beginning  of  the  transaction,
and this is known as direct cash credit such as loans and discounting
of commercial papers. Instead, indebtedness could be only probable
at the end of the transaction, and that is incidental credit, such as
, letters of guarantee, bills of acceptance, and letters
suretyship, letters of guarantee, bills of acceptance, and letters
bank suretyship
bank
of documentary credit. The term credit facilities is used to denote
credit in both cases. The concepts of credit and credit facilities are
more comprehensive than the concept of financing which relates to
the case of actual deferment of one of the two transacted objects.
2/2  According to this standard, credit facilities in institutions can be
divided into the following types:
2/2/1 Cash facilities: This type includes the transactions in which the
Institution presents funds, whether in the form of cash - as is
  (benevolent  loan),  Musharakah  and
Qard  Hasan  (benevolent  loan),  Musharakah  and
the  case  in  Qard  Hasan
the  case  in
Mudarabah; or in the form of an asset or usufruct - as is the
case  in  Murabahah  and  lease  financing.  It  should  be  noticed
here that Musharakah and Mudarabah do not result in a debt
owed by the client except in case of transgression or negligence.
2/2/2 Incidental facilities: This type includes the transactions which
result  in  an  incidental  commitment  owed  by  the  Institution
such as suretyship
such as
 and letters of guarantee.
suretyship and letters of guarantee.
926926
Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
2/3  Transactions that entail instant delivery of the transacted objects
are not considered as part of credit facilities.
2/4  The decision of granting credit facilities:
It refers to the approval of the Institution to enter into a credit facility
with a specific client. The approved facility will be subject to a specific
financial  limit  that  can  be  used  during  a  specific  period  of  validity
and  subject  to  a  certain  date  of  maturity.  The  credit  facility  would
also  comprise  specific  conditions  relating  to  guarantees,  method  of
repayment and regulatory requirements. The decision of granting the
facility is usually issued in the form of a letter addressed from the In-
stitution to the client, indicating that the letter does not constitute any
commitment from the part of the Institution unless transactions are
actually commenced. Similar to letters of granting facilities, letters for
renewal or extension of the period of already approved facilities also
carry the same conditions.
2/5  Using credit facilities
It  refers  to  commencement  of  the  client  to  utilize  the  facility  by
submitting a request for a letter of guarantee or a letter of credit, or
making a pledge to purchase a commodity or hire an asset through
the Institution.
3. Types of Credit Facilities
3/1  Types of traditional credit facilities used by banks:
3/1/1 Loans
Loans refer to facilities payable on a specific date agreed upon
between  the  traditional  financial  Institution  and  the  client.
Loans  can  be  extended  directly  to  the  client,  or  through
participation with other traditional financial Institutions, or
through acquisition of bonds issued by the client.
3/1/2 Overdraft

within a certain limit, and he can repay it in installments along
with the interest.
3/1/5 Documentary credits
Documentary credits are among the facilities which traditional
financial  Institutions  extend  to  their  clients.  In  this  case  the
Institution  assumes  the  commitment  to  pay  to  beneficiaries
the value of the credits opened for its client, whether the value
of such credits is due on sight of the documents or on a date
thereafter.
3/1/6 Bank acceptances
This type of facilities which traditional financial Institutions
offer  to  their  clients  entails  a  commitment  from  the  Institu-
tion, for the benefit of a client or for its own benefit, to pay to
beneficiaries the value of the accepted papers when they are
due.due.
3/1/7 Bank guarantees

their clients. In such facility the bank, upon request of its client,
undertakes to pay to a third party the amounts indicated in the
guarantees, on request and within a specific period.
3/1/8 Foreign exchange operations
Foreign  exchange  operations  constitute  a  traditional  facility
offered to clients in deferred contracts of buying and selling
foreign currency.
928928
Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
3/2  Types of Islamic credit facilities used by institutions
3/2/1 Murabahah and Musawamah
Murabahah and Musawamah are two types of sale transactions
which constitute methods of financing used by Islamic financial
institutions to cater for client needs for owning moveable as well
as immovable assets. Contrary to Musawamah, in Murabahah
the cost incurred by the Institution for obtaining the good must
be indicated. [see Shariah Standard No. (8) on Murabahah]
3/2/2 Mudarabah
Mudarabah is a method of financing which institutions use
for  financing  various  economic  activities.  According  to  this
method  the  institution  enters  the  deal  as  the  partner  who
subscribes  the  funds  (Rab  al-Mal)  while  the  other  partner
(Mudarib) subscribes the work and performs the managerial
duties. The two parties agree, within the contract, on a specific
method for profit sharing, while the entire loss has to be borne
by Rab al-Mal
 unless it is due to transgression or negligence
by Rab al-Mal, unless it is due to transgression or negligence
of the Mudarib. [see Shariah Standard No. (21) on Financial
Papers: Shares and Bonds]
3/2/3 Permanent Musharakah and diminishing Musharakah
 Musharakah is a method of financing in which the institution
joins the client as a shareholder in the capital of a certain project
or operation. In this case the two parties share the profits and
losses  according  to  a  predetermined  method  specified  in  the
contract.
3/2/4 Operational-cum-financing Ijarah
It  is  a  method  used  for  financing  clients  needs  for  usufructs
and assets. According to this method the institution purchases
the assets and rents them to clients for specific periods, against
periodical amounts of rent stipulated in the contract. [see Shariah
Standard No. (9) on Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek]
929929
Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
3/2/5 Istisnaa
Istisnaa is a method through which the institutions provide
finance  to  their  clients.  In  this  case  the  institution  assumes
the  commitment  of  manufacturing  the  equipment  or  the
good, or constructing the buildings or the different types of
capital  assets  according  to  the  specifications  agreed  upon.
The institution which provides finance in this manner has the
right to sign a Parallel Istisnaa contract with another party to
manufacture the asset in question.
3/2/6 Salam
Salam  is  a  method  of  financing  which  institutions  use  for
extending  finance  to  owners  of  farms  and  merchants  who
want to spend on their business as well as on their personal
needs.  Under  this  mode  of  financing  the  Institution  has  the
right to arrange Salam with another party through a parallel
Salam contract.
3/2/7 Other financing operations
Finance can also be extended to clients through other financing
, customer
Qard Hasan, customer
operations which include among others: Qard Hasan
operations which include among others:
overdraft balances, letters of guarantee and letters of credit.
4. Shariah Status of Offering Credit Facilities
  The decision to offer a credit facility and the facility agreement are considered
as means of mutual understanding and exchange of non-binding promises
for entering into transactions. The Shariah status of actual utilization of
the facilities depends on the type of contract to be used.
5. Shariah Rulings on Credit Facilities
5/1  It is impermissible to use any of the traditional facilities mentioned
in item 3/1 if it involves interest or would lead to an interest-bearing
loan as is the case in guarantees and uncovered credits, or it would
result  in  deferment  of  one  of  the  two  transacted  objects  as  is  the
case  in  currency  exchange  contracts.  [see  Shariah  Standard  No.
930930
Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
(14)  on  Documentary  Credit;  Shariah  Standard  No.  (2)  on  Debit,
Charge and Credit Cards; and Shariah Standard No. (1) on Trading
in Currencies]
5/2  The  institution  is  not  committed  to  pay  any  compensation  to  the
client on rejection of his application to utilize the approved facilities,
whereas the client also is free to use the facilities within the specified
period or not. When the client refrains from using the facilities, he
is not committed to pay any compensation to the Institution.
5/3  Returns and commission on credit facilities
5/3/1 First type: Commissions and returns which arise before con-
tracting
5/3/1/1 Commission for credit study
The institution is permitted to take commission for the
credit study it prepares internally or through an exter-
nal  party,  so  as  to  know  the  credit  worthiness  of  the
client and his ability to honor his commitments within
the period agreed upon. Entitlement of the Institution
to such commission is due to fact that the client has
benefited  from  the  study  regardless  of  whether  the
study has led to acceptance or rejection of his request.
The study shall become the property of the client who
has the right to take it.
5/3/1/2 Commission for offering credit facilities
This commission refers to the amount which the In-
stitution charges against allocating and specifying the
limit  of  the  facility.  The  institution  usually  charges
such  commission  whether  the  deal  is  finalized  or
not. However, it is impermissible for the Institution
to obtain commission for offering credit facilities, be-
cause the mere indication of willingness to enter into
a lending and borrowing transaction does not justify
remuneration.  [see  item  2/4/2  of  Shariah  Standard
No. (8) on Murabahah]
931931
Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement

Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
Shariah Basis for Charging a Fee for Preparation of the Credit Study
The credit study is a detailed study on the financial and credit position
of  the  client  so  as  to  facilitate  assessment  of  his  credit  worthiness  and
ability to honor commitments. According to Shariah, this task as such can
constitute  a  remunerable  service  apart  from  the  financing  contract.  The
institution can even stipulate a condition that the study should be prepared
by a third party. Charging the client for the credit study is also justified by
the fact that the benefit from the study is shared between the financier and
the financed party, rather than confined to the former only. The fee for the
study should not necessarily be equal to the actual cost of its preparation,
since  it  is  a  service  which  can  be  performed  independently  within  the
contract. Therefore, the credit agreement fee is considered as a fee payable
for the effort exerted in preparation of the study as an independent service,
irrespective of its results.
In this regard, the Shariah Board of Aayan Company for Leasing and
Finance issued a Fatwa (Fatawa Aayan: 189), indicating permissibility of
charging such fees. The text of that Fatwa runs as follows:
When  the  clients  of  Aayan  Company  wish  to  sign  with  Aayan
Company permissible investment or financing contracts through
Mudarabah, Musharakah or any other mode of financing, and if
Mudarabah,  Musharakah  or  any  other  mode  of  financing,  and  if
Aayan  Company,  for  that  purpose,  needs  to  conduct  a  study  on
the  financial  status  of  these  clients  and  their  legal  eligibility  for
concluding  such  contracts,  it  is  permissible  for  Aayan  Company
to sign special contracts with these clients so that Aayan Company
prepares  the  required  study.  For  preparation  of  the  study,  Aayan
Company may charge a fee to be paid by the clients on the basis of
938938
Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
the special contracts which should be completely separate from the
financing and legal contracts pertaining to the deals in question.
The prepared study should become the property of the client once
he pays the cost of its preparation, and therefore Aayan Company
should not deprive him the right of obtaining it. Aayan Company
should handover the study to the client so that he can be able to use
it in his deals with Aayan Company or with any other party.

Definitions
Financing
Financing takes place only when one of the two objects of the transaction
is  deferred  such  as  loan,  discounting  of  bills,  simple  credit,  Murabahah,
Salam  and  Istisnaa.  Financing  may  not  take  place  in
,  letters  of
suretyships,  letters  of
Salam  and  Istisnaa.  Financing  may  not  take  place  in  suretyships
guarantee, letters of documentary credits and bank acceptances. Therefore,
the term financing is more special than the term credit. That is to say, any
financing is credit, but any credit does not always lead to financing.
Indebted-Current
This is one of the traditional forms of extending loans to customers. In this
case the customer (borrower) is given access to draw from an account opened
for  this  purpose  (the  indebted-current  account)  up  to  a  certain  maximum
limit which constitutes the amount of the loan, and within a specific period.
A maximum date will also be specified for repayment of the drawn amounts.
Such account is usually made subject to the following terms:
The customer has to pay interest on the amounts he draws actually.
  The customer has to pay interest on the amounts he draws actually.
  The customer should pay a commitment fee calculable as a percentage
The customer should pay a commitment fee calculable as a percentage
of the total amount of the loan. Such amount is paid in addition to in-
terest and is considered as Riba (usury).
The indebted-current account differs from the direct loan in that interest
in the case of the former is paid at the end of the transactions period. In
the indebted-current account also interest is calculable on the basis of the
amounts that have been actually used by the customer (the debit balance).
Facility Limits
The maximum limit of the facility is the total amount of the facility that has
been approved by the institution. Such amount is extended through a specific
mode  of  financing  (Murabahah,  Ijarah,  letter  of  guarantee,  documentary
940940
Shariah Standard No. (37): Credit Agreement
credit .etc.). It constitutes the maximum exposure limit for the institution
with regard to the specific client.
Credit Policy
Credit  policy  refers  to  the  precautionary  measures  adopted  by  the
Institution with the aim of safeguarding its funds in the light of rules and
regulations and in view of the resolutions of its Shariah Supervisory Board
and the prevailing principles and traditions in the field of its activities.
Credit Study
The credit study is the process of identifying the credit worthiness of
the client and his ability to honor his commitments within the specified
period. It also aims to assess the suitability of the type, size and currency of
the requested financing to the activity to be financed, and to what extent
the financing is commensurate with the resources and capabilities of the
client  in  general.  Moreover,  the  credit  study  indicates  -  subject  to  the
nature  of  financing  operations  -  the  suitable  guarantees  to  be  requested
from the client, whether for the debts and entitlements stemming from the
operations or against transgression and negligence from his part. The final
result of the study presents a clear recommendation on whether the client
is to be offered the facility subject to certain conditions, or his application
should be rejected on the basis of specific reasons.
The credit study covers the financial standing, cash flow, activity results,
income,  and  expenses  of  the  client.  It  also  covers  other  various  aspects
such as past experience of the institution with the same client, image of the
client, and his ability to manage his activity and stand any difficulties he
may encounter while practicing such activity.
Facility Agreement
This agreement is signed between the client who applies for the facility
and the institution when the decision to offer the facility is issued. The
agreement  indicates  the  type  and  amount  of  the  facility  as  well  as  the
guarantees and profit margin, or profit sharing ratio in case of Musharakah
in Islamic transactions. Such agreement is not considered to be binding
for the client before entering into the actual contracts.

Shariah Standard No. (38): Online Financial Dealings
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This standard covers the Shariah rulings relating to conclusion of financial
contracts online, either by launching commercial websites, or by provision
of online access services. The standard aims to indicate the various aspects
pertaining  to  this  subject  such  as  the  Shariah  status  of  the  contracts
concluded in this manner, determination of the time of contract inception,
permissible  procedures  of  possession  after  signing  the  contract,  and
Shariah rulings relating to protection of online financial dealings.
2. Launching Commercial Websites for Contractual Dealings
2/1  It is permissible in Shariah to launch commercial websites, provided
that such sites do not involve any impermissible act, such as promotion
of impermissible goods and services, or using impermissible means
to promote pemissible goods and services.
2/2  It is permissible in Shariah to conclude online contracts, provided that
the contracts thus concluded between the institution and its clients
observe the general rules of financial transactions as prescribed by the
Shariah, regarding for instance, opening of the accounts, performing
remittances and signing commercial contracts.
3. Provision of Online Access Services
3/1  Shariah permits institutions to provide online access services to users on
the basis of subscription contracts or any other similar arrangement,
and against a specific fee.
3/2  The contract for provision of online access service by the institution
is a shared-hiring contract 
 signed between the
Ijarah Mushtarakah signed between the
is a shared-hiring contract Ijarah Mushtarakah
institution and the beneficiary. Therefore, it should become subject
to the conditions and rulings of the contract for hiring of persons in
general, and those of the contract for hiring of a shared employee in

Shariah Standard No. (38): Online Financial Dealings
particular. [see Shariah Standard No. (34) on Hiring of Persons and
Shariah Standard No. (9) on Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek]
3/3  The institution which provides such service should take all necessary
precautions and measures to prevent impermissible use of the inter-
net by the beneficiaries to whom the Institution provides the access
service.
4. Contract  Signing  Session  (Majlis  al-Aqd
4. Contract  Signing  Session  (
)  for  Concluding  Online
Majlis  al-Aqd)  for  Concluding  Online
Financial Contracts
4/1  When the contract is concluded through audio or audiovisual com-
munication between the two parties, it should become subject to the
same Shariah rulings on contracts signed in the presence of the two
parties.  Consequently  it  should  satisfy  the  rulings  relating  to  this
type of contracts which include, for instance: simultaneous presence
), non-existence of any indication
Itihad al-Majlis), non-existence of any indication
of the two parties (Itihad al-Majlis
of the two parties (
of  disinterest  from  any  of  the  two  parties,  succession  of  offer  and
acceptance (as per normal practice), and all the other rulings.
4/1/1 The contract signing session in this case is the time of com-
munication between the two parties if the conversation relates
to the contract. If the conversation is over or disconnected, or
the two parties shifted to another subject, the contract signing
session is considered to have stopped (unless disconnection of
the conversation is for a reasonably short while).
4/2  When the contract is concluded through written communication,
by e-mail, or through access to site, it shall become subject to the
rulings  applicable  to  contracts  signed  in  the  absence  of  the  two
parties, because such deal is similar to message contracting.
4/2/1 The contract signing session in the case indicated in item 4/2
above starts from the moment of communicating the offer to
the concerned party up to issuance of acceptance. The contract
signing  session  may  also  be  discontinued  when  the  offering
party retreats from his offer before an acceptance decision is
made by the other party.
949949
Shariah Standard No. (38): Online Financial Dealings
4/2/2 When the offering party specifies a certain period for validity
of his offer, the time allowed for acceptance should cover the
whole  period.  The  offering  party  has  no  right  to  withdraw
from his offer during that period.
4/3  When the contract is concluded through online bidding the highest
bidder  should  not  retreat  from  his  bid  until  the  bidding  process  is
over. The highest bidder should also not retreat from his offer after
finalization of the bidding process if the seller had made a condition
that  the  offer  should  remain  binding  for  a  certain  period,  or  if  the
normal practice necessitates validity of the offer for such period.
5. Expressing Offer and Acceptance in Online Financial Contracts
5/1  Expression of offer and acceptance in online contracts can be in any
form that indicates the consent of the two parties to conclude the
contract.
5/2  When the offering party sends through website or e-mail a message
containing all the rights and commitments pertaining to the contract
in question without retaining the right of withdrawal if the message
is accepted, that message is considered as an offer.
5/3  When the offering party sends the electronic message through website
or e-mail without indicating all the rights and commitments relating
to the contract in question, or when he stipulates a condition that he
should have the right of withdrawal even if the message is accepted,
the message is considered to be an announcement or an invitation for
contracting  rather  than  an  offer.  In  this  case  a  process  of  offer  and
acceptance has to be done.
5/4  When  the  contract  is  concluded  through  website,  clicking  on  the
acceptance  icon  is  considered  as  acceptance  in  the  strict  Shariah
sense if the system in the website does not require confirmation of
acceptance. If the system in the website requires confirmation of ac-
ceptance in any way, acceptance does not take place without making
such confirmation.
950950
Shariah Standard No. (38): Online Financial Dealings
5/4/1 The Institution which provides its services on website should
include in the system a step for acceptance confirmation as
a precautionary measure against dealers mistakes.
6. Time of Commencement of an Online Contract
Irrespective of the method of contracting, an online contract is considered
to be valid since the time when the other party accepts the offer and
whether the offering party has come to know that or not.
7. Possession (Qabd) in Online Financial Contracts
7/1  Regarding  online  contracts,  possession  in  the  strict  Shariah  sense
takes place through all accepted methods of actual and constructive
possession.  [see  Shariah  Standard  No.  (18)  on  Possession  (Qabd),
items 3 and 5]
7/2  If the sold commodity is computer software or the like, possession in
the strict Shariah sense takes place when the purchaser, after signing
the contract, downloads the software or the data or any good of this
type from the website to his personal computer.
7/3  When  the  sold  commodity  is  a  currency,  gold,  silver  or  any  other
commodity in which instant exchange (Taqabud) is required, instant
exchange  of  the  two  objects  of  the  contract  should  be  ascertained
during the contracts signing session.
8. Protection of Online Financial Dealings
8/1  Protection of commercial sites and dealers data against being trespassed
8/1/1 Commercial websites are considered as private properties of
their owners, and therefore their trespassing could necessitate
compensation.
8/1/2 The  institution  should  use  all  possible  measures  of  website
protection, so as to safeguard its own rights as well as the rights
of its clients.
8/1/3 Trespassing of dealers online data is impermissible. It is strictly
prohibited to sell such data or transmit it to others without the
permission of its owners.
951951
Shariah Standard No. (38): Online Financial Dealings
8/1/4  Verification of trespassing of commercial sites and data stealing
should be done by referring to the prevailing traditions and
regulating rules which do not encounter the rules and principles
of Shariah.
8/1/5 The compensation due in case of trespassing should comprise
direct financial loss as well as actual loss of earnings. Expert
advice for assessment of compensation can also be sought
when
advice for assessment of compensation can also be sought when
need arises.
8/1/6  Compensation shall become due only when it is claimed, whereas
claiming compensation does not have a specific time limit after
the incident of trespassing is known. In this regard relevant rules
and  regulations  should  be  observed  provided  that  they  do  not
contradict with the rules and principles of Shariah.
8/1/7 In case of stealing money or confidential data from a protected
website the responsibility should rest with the person who com-
mitted the theft directly. If it is not possible, for a permissible
reason, to charge the person who committed the act of theft di-
rectly, the responsibility should rest with the one who facilitated
the act. The owner of the site is by no means chargeable for such
act, if he has taken all possible measures to protect his site, and
unless he has pledged to shoulder such responsibility under all
circumstances.
8/2  Verification of dealers identities
8/2/1 In order to safeguard its own interests, the Institution should
identities
take all possible precautions and measures to verify the identities
take all possible precautions and measures to verify the
of  its  website  dealers,  and  make  sure  that  they  are  legally
competent for concluding valid contracts.
8/2/2 It  is  acceptable  in  Shariah  to  adopt  the  electronic  signature
as a means of verifying the identities of dealers, provided that
such means is adoptable by virtue of the prevailing rules and
regulations.
952952
Shariah Standard No. (38): Online Financial Dealings
8/2/3 When  forgery  or  an  error  is  committed  with  regard  to  the
personality  or  characteristics  of  one  of  the  two  parties,  the
other party has the right to terminate the contract.
8/2/4 For verification of forgery or error recourse should be to the
general rules of evidence.
Uqud al-Izan)
8/3  Protection of dealers from adhesion contracts (Uqud al-Izan
8/3  Protection of dealers from adhesion contracts (
8/3/1  It can be noticed that in a big part of the online contracts the
offer is addressed to the public in general and the contract has
uniform details. In such contracts also the offering party alone
has  the  right  of  stipulating  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
contract, while the other party does not have the right to change
such terms and conditions. A contract of this type is considered
as  an  adhesion  contract  when  it  relates  to  a  commodity  or
usufruct  that  nobody  can  do  without,  and  the  offering  party
assumes actual and legal monopoly or face only meager degree
of competition in its supplying.
8/3/2  According  to  Shariah,  online  adhesion  contracts  should  be
subject to state control so as to protect dealers by endorsement

is equitable and elimination of what is inequitable in

8/3/3 If the price in the online adhesion contract is fair, and the terms
and conditions of the contract do not entail any injustice for
the adhering party, the contract is considered to be permissible
and binding to its two parties.
8/3/4 If the price in the online adhesion contract is unfair (comprises
excessive injustice), or the contract includes an unjust condition
for the adhering party, the latter has the right to resort to law for
nullification of the contract or amending its conditions for the
sake of relieving him from the consequent injustice.
8/4  If  the  online  contract  is  concluded  on  the  basis  of  describing  the
sold object, or depending on the fact that the buyer has previously
seen the object, or on presentation of a model resembling the object,
953953
Shariah Standard No. (38): Online Financial Dealings
whereas at the time of delivery the sold object is found to be different,
the buyer should have the choice between concluding the contract,
terminating it, or negotiating with the seller appropriate means of
settlement.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  The  basis  for  permissibility  of  launching  commercial  websites  if  such
The  basis  for  permissibility  of  launching  commercial  websites  if  such
sites  are  free  from  impermissible  practices  is  the  fact  that  in  principle,
transactions  in  any  form  are  allowed,  unless  they  lead  to  commitment
of  an  impermissible  act.  Moreover,  launching  of  such  sites  serves  the
interests of a large number of people in this era, and thus, conforms to
the underlying mission of Shariah.
  Permissibility of concluding online financial contracts is due to the fact
Permissibility of concluding online financial contracts is due to the fact
that such contracts do not involve any impermissible aspect. They carry
no difference from traditional contracts except in that the means used for
their conclusion is different. If, in principle, contracts as such are allowed
as  long  as  they  observe  the  rules  of  transactions  in  Shariah,  it  is  only
natural  that  the  means  whereby  these  contracts  are  concluded  become
allowed as long as they conform to permissible rules of contracting.

 is fulfilled at the time of exchanging offer and acceptance.
In  this  connection  the  International  Islamic  Fiqh  Academy  issued
a resolution about the Shariah ruling on concluding contracts through
the  modern  means  of  communication.  The  text  of  the  resolution  is
as  follows:  If  any  two  parties  enter  into  a  contract  at  the  same  time
while  they  are  in  different  places    this  includes  contracting  through

  When  the  contract  is  concluded  through  written  communication,  by
e-mail, or through access to site, it shall be classified as a contract signed in
the absence of the two parties. This ruling is based on the fact that exchange
of  offer  and  acceptance  in  this  case  takes  place  without  simultaneous
presence of the two parties. In this regard the Al Baraka Seminar on Islamic
Economics  issued  a  resolution  stating  that  According  to  Shariah,  when
an online contract is signed between two parties who are not in the same
place, it is considered as a contract between two absent parties if neither of
the two parties can hear the voice of the other. Consequently such contract
should become subject to the Shariah rulings on message contracting.(4)(4)

his offer within the period specified by the seller for validity of the offer
is based on the viewpoint of some Maliki scholars who believe that if
an offer is announced to be valid for a specific period it should remain
valid throughout that period. This viewpoint has been emphasized by Al-
Hattab quoting Abu Bakar Al-Arabi.(5)(5) In this regard also The International
Hattab quoting Abu Bakar Al-Arabi.
 In this regard also The International
Islamic  Fiqh  Academy  issued  a  resolution  emphasizing  the  following:

The  ruling  that  irrespective  of  the  method  of  contracting  an  online
contract is considered to be valid since the time when the other party
accepts the offer and whether the offering party has come to know that
or  not,  is  based  on  the  fact  that  Shariah  scholars  define  contract  as
the concordance of two wills. Therefore as soon as the accepting party
declares  his  consent  concordance  between  the  two  wills  takes  place
and  the  contract  becomes  valid.(8)(8)  A  resolution  issued  in  this  regard
and  the  contract  becomes  valid.
  A  resolution  issued  in  this  regard
by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy states: When a contract is
to be signed, through a written message or a messenger, between two
absent parties who are not in the same place and neither of them can
see or hear the other - a case which includes contracting through telex,
fax and PC screens - the validity of such contract starts as soon as the
concerned party receives and accepts the offer.(9)(9)

on the fact that possession takes place actually and constructively when the
sold object is released and disposition is facilitated for the buyer. Possession
of objects differs according to the type of the object in question and how
its possession is normally perceived. In this respect a resolution has been

the option of terminating the contract for false description. This ruling
is based on the need for preservation of the rights of the two parties of
the contract, as has been emphasized by the majority of Fiqh scholars.

Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  standard  covers  mortgages  requested  by  the  Institution  with  the
aim  of  documenting  the  debts  and  commitments  owed  to  it  by  other
individuals  and  Institutions.  It  is  also  covers  the  mortgages  presented
by  the  Institution  to  other  parties  in  order  to  document  the  debts  and
commitments  it  owes  to  them.  Furthermore,  the  standard  covers  the
mortgages which the Institution, in its capacity as a notary or agent, keeps
for the benefit of other parties.
2. Definition of Mortgage
  To mortgage means to make a financial asset or so tied to a debt so that
the asset or its value is used for repayment of the debt in case of default.
3. Shariah Rulings on Mortgage
3/1  Mortgage  is  permissible  in  Qur`an,  Sunnah  (Prophetic  tradition)
and Ijma (consensus of Fuqaha).
3/1/1 The mortgage contract is binding for the mortgagor once it
is concluded, and the mortgagor does not have the right to
revoke it from his own side, whereas the mortgagee has the
right to do so.
3/1/2  Possession of the mortgaged asset takes place on the basis of the
same requirements for possession of a sold property. It could be
actual  possession  by  putting  a  hand  on  the  property,  which  is
known as seizure mortgage; or possession could be legal through
registration and documentation, which is known as security or
formal mortgage. Both types of mortgages are subject to the
same rulings.
3/1/3  The mortgagee has the right to appoint an agent to possess the
mortgage on his behalf. The agent, thus appointed, should have
968968
Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
the  same  rights  of  disposition  which  the  principal  has.  The
mortgage  can  also  be  put  in  the  hands  of  the  mortgagee  or  in
the  hands  of  a  third  party  known  as  the  notary,  to  be  agreed
upon  between  the  two  parties.  When  the  mortgage  is  kept  by
a notary neither of the two parties has the right to transfer it to
any other location.
3/1/4 The mortgagee has the right to stipulate a condition that the
mortgagor  should  appoint  him  or  his  representative  as  an
agent who can sell the mortgaged asset and repay the debt out
of its value in case of default, without resorting to judiciary.
The  mortgagor  does  not  have  the  right  to  retreat  from  such
agency once agreed upon.
3/1/5 The death of the mortgagor or the mortgagee has no effect on
the validity of the mortgage contract. The respective inheritors
shall substitute the dead party.
3/1/6 The mortgage contract is no longer valid when the mortgaged
asset perishes unless a compensation for it is obtained (through
solidarity insurance, for instance). The mortgage contract can
also cease to be valid for other reasons such as termination of
the contract by the mortgagee, settlement of or relief from the
debt,  or  relinquishment  of  the  mortgage  right.  Furthermore,
the validity of the mortgage contract can also expire as a result
of transfer of the ownership of the mortgaged asset (through
sale,  gift  or  will)  on  permission  of  the  mortgagee;  unless  the
new  owner  accepts  to  keep  the  mortgage  contract.  [see  item
3/2/6]
3/1/7 The mortgagee has the right to keep the whole mortgaged asset
for any part of the debt, unless he accepts partial releasing of
the  mortgage.  On  repayment  of  the  debt  the  mortgagee  has
no right to keep the mortgaged asset as a collateral for a new
debt for which the asset is not mortgaged, except when the two
parties agree to keep the mortgaged asset as a collateral for any
debt between them within a specific period.
969969
Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
3/2  Rulings relating to the mortgaged asset
3/2/1 The mortgaged asset should be a Shariah-permissible proper-
ty. It should also be well specified (through pointing, naming
or description) and can possibly be delivered.
3/2/2 In principle, the mortgaged object should be a tangible asset, yet
it can be a debt, a cash amount, a fungible asset or a consumable
commodity. Perishable objects can also be mortgaged as they
can be sold and replaced by their value. Moreover, a mortgaged
object can be a share of common property which can be
identified
object can be a share of common property which can be identified
and sold separately.
3/2/3 The same asset can be mortgaged to more than one mortgagee.
If  all  mortgages  are  of  the  same  rank  the  consent  of  all  the
parties has to be sought, and the mortgage right in the asset is to
be shared among them in proportion to their respective debts.
If  the  mortgages  are  ranked  in  such  a  way  that  a  succeeding
mortgagee should get his debt repaid only when his precedent
mortgagee does, the consent of the succeeding mortgagee alone
has to be sought.
3/2/4 The mortgaged asset is a trust in the hands of the mortgagee,
the notary or the agent and is still owned by the mortgagor as
long  as  it  is  mortgaged.  Therefore  when  the  mortgaged  asset
perishes  in  the  hands  of  the  mortgagee,  the  notary  or  the
agent, for a reason other than transgression or negligence, no
responsibility shall rest with him, and the debt shall still remain
valid. If the perish of the mortgaged asset is due to transgression
or negligence of the mortgagee, the agent or the notary he shall
be held responsible for compensation at the value of the asset
on the date of its perish, whereas the debt shall remain valid.
In this case the two parties have the right to perform clearance
arrangements  between  the  debt  amount  and  the  value  of  the
perished mortgage asset.
3/2/5 The mortgagor can mortgage an asset that is owed to him by
the  mortgagee,  whether  the  asset  is  kept  by  the  mortgagee
970970
Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
as  a  trust  (such  as  deposited  or  lent  assets  and  investment
accounts); or as a guaranteed asset (such as current accounts
and assets retained after nullification of contracts). In the latter
case the status of the mortgagee will consequently change from
keeping the asset on guarantee basis to keeping it on the basis
of trust.
3/2/6 The  mortgagor  can  mortgage  a  borrowed  asset  (borrowed
mortgage), or a rented asset (rented mortgage), on permission
of the owner in both cases. If a borrowed or rented mortgage
is used for repayment of the defaulted debt, the owner of the
asset should have the right of recourse on the mortgagor for
compensation;  in  kind  if  the  mortgaged  asset  is  a  fungible
asset, or in value if otherwise. When a borrowed or rented
mortgage asset perishes in the hands of the mortgagor, the
mortgagor  has  to  compensate  the  owner  of  the  borrowed
asset, whereas for the rented asset compensation is deserved
only if the perish of the mortgaged asset is due to transgression
or negligence of the mortgagor.
3/2/7 In a sale contract the seller has the right to stipulate a condition
that  the  buyer,  after  actual  or  constructive  possession  of  the
good, should mortgage it to him against the deferred price.
3/2/8 Appreciation in the value of the mortgaged asset as well as its
income is considered to be mortgaged along with the principal,
unless the two parties agree otherwise.
3/2/9  The mortgagor can benefit from the mortgaged asset on permis-
sion of the mortgagee, whereas the mortgagee has no right at all
to enjoy free of charge benefit from the mortgaged asset with or
without the permission of the mortgagor. However, on permis-
sion of the mortgagor the mortgagee can utilize the mortgaged
asset against the normal pay for similar assets. [see items 3/3/
and 4/3]
3/2/10 The  mortgagor  should  bear  all  actual  expenses  relating  to
reparation of the mortgaged asset and its preservation against
971971
Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
decay.  When  the  mortgagee  pays  such  expenses  with  or
without the permission of the mortgagor he has the right of
recourse on the mortgagor for compensation or he may obtain
compensation in terms of an equivalent period of benefiting
from the mortgaged assets. The mortgagee should bear all the
expenses relating to safekeeping, documentation and selling
of the mortgaged asset, except when the two parties agree that
the mortgagor should bear such expenses.
3/2/11 With due consideration to item (5), it is permissible to mortgage
debt, whether such debt is owed by the mortgagee or anyone
else.
3/2/12 Possession of a mortgaged debt takes place by possession of
the debts document or by attestation of the debt at the time
of its mortgaging. When a debt is mortgaged, the mortgagee
becomes more entitled to it than anyone else.
3/3  Rulings relating to the debt for which the mortgage is signed
3/3/1 The debt for which the mortgage is signed should be a per-
missible debt such as sale income, guarantee against damage,
Salam commodity, Istisnaa commodity or an owed usufruct.
Concluding a valid mortgage contract need not necessarily be
preceded by establishing the debt. The mortgage contract can
be signed before or at the same time of signing the debt con-
tract. The debt for which the mortgage is signed should not be
a impermissible debt (such as a usurious loan); or a non-debt
deal (such as a specific price, the usufruct of a specific asset,
and  a  spot  sale  commodity  that  is  still  in  the  hands  of  the
seller).
3/3/2 It is impermissible to stipulate mortgage as a condition in trust-
based contracts such as agency, deposit, Musharakah, Mudara-
bah and leasing contracts. If mortgage in such contracts is to
be confined to indemnity in case of transgression, negligence
or  breach  of  the  contract,  then  it  is  permissible.  [see  Shariah
Standard No. (5) on Guarantees, item 2/2/1]
972972
Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
3/4  Execution of the mortgage
3/4/1 With due consideration to item 3/1/4, the mortgagee has the
right to claim the sale of the mortgaged asset in case of default.
After repayment of the mortgagees debt the remaining value
of  the  mortgaged  asset  should  be  given  to  the  mortgagor
by  virtue  of  the  mortgage  contract.  If  the  sale  value  of  the
mortgaged  asset  happened  to  be  less  than  the  due  debt,  the
difference shall be subject to Shariah rulings on normal debt,
and  the  mortgagee  should  have  the  right  of  recourse  on  the
mortgagor for settlement of such difference.
3/4/2 The mortgagee does not have the right to stipulate a condition
that he should own the asset in case of default. Nevertheless,
there  is  no  prohibition  for  the  mortgagee  to  purchase  the
mortgaged asset from the mortgagor at market value, and take
the portion of the value to which he is entitled.
3/5/3 When the mortgagor is bankrupt, the mortgagee should have
the  priority  over  other  debtors,  for  getting  his  debt  repaid
from  the  sale  value  of  the  mortgaged  asset.  If  the  sale  value
of  the  mortgaged  asset  is  less  than  the  mortgagees  debt,  he
becomes in the same standing with other debtors with regard
to the excess indebtedness.
4. Mortgage of Financial Papers and Sukuk
4/1  It is permissible to mortgage the financial papers and Sukuk which
can be issued and transacted according to Shariah, such as Islamic
Sukuk  and  shares  of  Islamic  financial  Institutions.  The  shares  of
the companies whose original activities are permissible can also be
added to this category. [see Shariah Standard No. (21) on Financial
Paper: Shares and Bonds, item 3/4]
4/2  It is permissible to mortgage usufruct-based Sukuk which represent
common shares in the usufructs of specific assets, or assets in the
form  of  a  specific  indebtedness.  This  should  be  taken  with  due
consideration to Shariah Standard No. (17) on Investment Sukuk,
item 5/1/5/2.
973973
Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
4/3  It is impermissible to mortgage the financial papers and Sukuk that
should  not  be  issued  or  transacted  according  to  Shariah,  such  as
interest-based bonds, preference shares and enjoyment shares [see
Shariah  Standard  No.  (21)  on  Financial  Paper:  Shares  and  Bonds,
items  2/6  and  2/7].  Such  financial  papers  include  also  traditional
investment certificates, certificates of traditional investment deposits
and  shares  of  the  companies  that  pursue  impermissible  activities
like manufacturing of alcohols, swine trade and dealing in Riba [see
Shariah  Standard  No.  (21)  on  Financial  Paper:  Shares  and  Bonds,
item  2/1  and  Shariah  Standard  No.  (14)  on  Documentary  Credit,
items 3/4/1 and 3/4/2]. Among these financial papers also are shares
of  traditional  financial  Institutions,  shares  of  traditional  financial
companies, shares of traditional insurance companies and shares of
companies which originally pursue permissible activities, yet Riba-
based and other prohibited dealings constitute a predominant part
of their activities.
5. Mortgage of Current Accounts and Cash Securities
  When a current account is mortgaged for the benefit of the same institu-
tion with which it is opened, the institution should not use the account
unless  an  agreement  is  reached  between  the  two  parties  to  transfer  the
account to an investment account, and thus, make it subject to the rulings
on Mudarabah instead of the rulings on loan. This is so because the in-
stitution, as a mortgagee, has to avoid making free of charge benefit from
the mortgaged account. On transference of the account to an investment
account,  the  account  holder  becomes  entitled  to  his  profit  share  as  the
owner of the capital (Rab al-Mal), while the institution becomes entitled
to its profit share as the worker (Mudarib).
6. Mortgage of Investment Units and Investment Accounts
6/1  The Institution can accept mortgage in the form of investment units
in Islamic investment funds. In this case the Institution as a mortgagee
can suspend the right of the client to get back or draw from the account,
absolutely  or  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  the  debt,  whichever  is
more suitable.
974974
Shariah Standard No. (39): Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications
6/2  The  income  and  growth  earned  by  the  units  or  the  account  are
considered to be mortgaged along with the principal. This should
hold true whether the contractual relationship between the client
and the Institution or the fund is Mudarabah or investment agency,
unless the two parties agree on other arrangement.
7. Mortgage of What Will Be Owned
It is permissible to mortgage an income which is still to be owned if the
principal (income earning asset) is specified. The contract in this case is
valid whether such income is to be mortgaged along with the principal
or independently.
8. Insurance of the Mortgaged Asset
  The mortgagee has the right at the time of signing the contract to request
from  the  mortgagor  to  arrange  Islamic  insurance  for  the  mortgaged
asset whenever it is possible. When the mortgagor accepts to do so the
compensation to be received on the damage of the mortgaged asset shall
replace it. If the compensation is received in the form of a cash amount
such amount shall be mortgaged along with its returns by depositing it
in a frozen investment account owned by the mortgagor. [see Shariah
Standard No. (5) on Guarantees, item 4/8]
9. Zakah on the Mortgaged Asset
9/1  The owner of the mortgaged asset should pay Zakah if it is payable
on the asset and its income or on its income only. The fact that the
owner  cannot  dispose  of  the  mortgaged  asset  does  not  relief  him
from payment of Zakah.
9/2  Zakah is payable on all cash mortgages such as current accounts, cash
securities,  units  of  investment  funds,  frozen  investment  accounts,
Sukuk,  Salam  debts,  and  Istisnaa  debts,  subject  to  stipulations  of
Shariah Standard No. (35) on Zakah, items 5/1, 5/2 and 5/3.
10. Date of Issuance of the Standard
  This Standard was issued on 17 Rabi I, 1430 A.H., corresponding to 15
March 2009 A.D.

Brief History of
the Preparation of the Standard
In  its  meeting  No.  (16)  held  in  Al-Madinah  Al-Munawwarah  on
7-12  Jumada  I,  1427  A.H.,  corresponding  to  3-8  June  2006  A.D.,  the
Shariah Board decided to issue a Shariah standard on Mortgage and Its
Contemporary Applications.
On  12  Rajab  1427  A.H.,  corresponding  to  6  August  2005  A.D.,  the
Secretariat General decided to commission a Shariah consultant to prepare
a study on Mortgage and Its Contemporary Applications.
A joint committee composed from Shariah Standards Committees (1)
and (2) held a meeting in the Kingdom of Bahrain, on 24 Rabi II, 1428
A.H., corresponding to 11 May 2007 A.D., the joint committee discussed
the study, and asked the consultant to introduce necessary changes in the
light of the discussions and observations of the meeting.
In a further meeting of the joint committee, held in the State of Kuwait
on 21 Jumada I, 1428 A.H., corresponding to 7 June 2007 A.D., the draft of
the standard was discussed and necessary amendments were introduced in
the light of the discussions and observations of the meeting.
In  its  meeting  No.  (22)  held  in  the  Kingdom  of  Bahrain,  on  2830
Dhul-Qadah 1430 A.H., corresponding to 26-28 November 2008 A.D., the
Shariah Board discussed the amendments made by the joint meetings of
the Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2) and introduced the changes
which it deemed necessary.
The Secretarial General of AAOIFI held a public hearing in the Kingdom
of Bahrain on 24 Safar 1430 A.H., corresponding to 19 February 2009 A.D.
More than 30 participants attended the session as representatives of central
977977

banks, institutions, and accounting firms. The session was also attended by
Shariah  scholars,  university  teachers  and  other  interested  parties.  Several
observations  were  made  in  the  session,  and  duly  responded  to  by  the
members of the Shariah Standards Committees (1) and (2).
In its meeting No. (23) held in the Kingdom of Bahrain, on Thursday
 Saturday 1517 Rabi I, 1430 A.H., corresponding to 12-15 March 2009

a a different interpretation for the Verse:
Traveling (adds Ibn Al-Mundhir) is referred to in the Verse as the pre-
dominant case where mortgage is needed, since traveling parties would
most probably be in lack of a scribe. Hence the verse, although it mentions
traveling, it does not stipulate it as a condition for concluding mortgage
contracts. Mortgage is also not obligatory, a fact which - to my knowledge
- has encountered no dispute. The emphasis on mortgage in the Verse in-
dicates guidance rather than obligation, because Allah, the Almighty, says:

The mortgaged asset should be a Shariah-permissible property because
the underlying objective is to sell this asset for settlement of the debt in
case of default. Therefore if the mortgaged asset is an impermissible pro-

or one person mortgages his asset to two person so that they can possess it together,

agreed that when someone borrows an object from someone else so as to mortgage it for
obtaining a specific amount of money from a specific person for a specific period, his act
is permissible. Ibn Al-Mundhir has also reported a unanimous agreement among Fiqh
scholars that if the person (in the preceding example) borrowed the object according to
the above stated conditions, but he mortgaged something else, his act is impermissible.
If such person mortgaged the borrowed object for a debt amount that exceeds what he
had  stated  when  borrowing  the  object,  the  mortgage  becomes  null  and  void  either  for
the whole amount of the debt as emphasized by Al-Shafiee, or for the excess part only, on
the basis of deal fragmentation. According to Al-Qadhi when the object to be mortgaged
is  borrowed  without  restrictions,  the  process  of  borrowing  is  permissible  and  the
borrower can mortgage the borrowed object for any amount. This viewpoint is one of two
viewpoints supported by Al-Shafii. The other viewpoint emphasized by Al-Shafiee is that
mortgage of a borrowed asset is impermissible without knowledge of the amount, nature
and maturity of the debt to be mortgaged for. When the borrowed mortgage asset perishes
the guarantee resets with the mortgagor, since a borrowed property has to be guaranteed
by the borrower. There is also the case when the person from whom the mortgaged asset
is borrowed releases the mortgaged asset without resorting to the mortgagor, and whether
he should resort to the mortgagor in this case or not. Fiqh scholars are divided between
two standpoints concerning this issue, as they do with regard to the case of someone who
repays the debt of someone else without his permission, Shamsul-Deen (Ibn Qudamah),

 According to the Hanafi School expenses of a mortgaged asset
are of two types: the first type includes all the expenses which relate to
maintenance of the proper state of the asset and its preservation against
decay, and such expenses should be borne by the mortgagor. The second
type comprises expenses such as those relating to safekeeping of the asset,
or returning it back to mortgagor, or returning back part of it which has
been  damaged  by  an  accident;  and  such  expenses  have  to  be  borne  by
the  mortgagee.  Furthermore,  the  Hanafi  scholars  indicate:  When  the
mortgagee without the permission of the competent authority bears the
expenses that should have been borne by the mortgagor, he is considered
to have done so in donation, whereas when he does so on permission of
the competent authority he has the right of recourse on the mortgagor
for repayment. Similarly, the mortgagor is considered as a donor when
he bears the expenses that should have been borne by the mortgagee wi-
thout  the  permission  of  the  concerned  authority,  and  should  have  the
right of recourse on the mortgagee when he does so, on permission of the

there and it needs documentation. The second case is when the mortgaged
contract is signed at the same time of signing the debt contract, as when
 for instance  one party says to the other: I sell to you this garment of
mine for ten dinars payable after a month provided that you mortgage to
me your slave Saad, and the other party responses: I agree to that. The
mortgage contract in this second case is also valid, according to Al-Sha-
fii and Ashab Al-Ra`y, because it is needed. The third case is when the
mortgage contract is signed before the debt contract, as when - for ins-
tance  one party says to the other: I mortgage this slave of mine to you
against lending me ten dinars. In this third case the mortgage contract is
invalid according to the prevailing view point of the Hanbali School, while
Al-Shafii considers it to be valid. The proponents of the validity of the
contract in this case include also Abu Al-Khattab, Malik and Abu Hani-
fah. It is argued that the mortgage contract in this case is a documentation
of a valid right and therefore it can precede it, similar to the case of gua-
rantee. A further justification given by Fiqh scholars in this connection is
that the mortgage contract in this case is signed for something which will
take place in the future, and therefore it is similar to a darak guarantee

It is permissible to mortgage Sukuk because, similar to shares, they repre-

Sukuk can be a common share of only one type of these assets (cash, or
debts or usufructs or tangible assets), [see Shariah Standard on Invest-
ment Sukuk]. As we have seen previously Fiqh scholars indicate that it
is  permissible  to  mortgage  common  property  as  well  as  cash,  tangible
assets and debts. Although there is no Shariah or Fiqh text that permits
or prohibits mortgaging of usufructs, yet I can see no Shariah restriction
against it, if such usufructs are Shariah-acceptable and their mortgaging
could achieve the Shariah objective of Preservation of rights and docu-
mentation of debts, through sale of the mortgaged asset and repayment
of the debt in case of default. Achievement of such objective appears to
be possible through mortgaging of the Sukuk issued against usufructs of
assets (in hand and with debtors). [see Shariah Standard on Investment
Sukuk, 5/1/5/2]

this case becomes kept by the institution on trust basis, rather than on guarantee basis.
As can be understood from what has been stated by Imam Ahmad, the mortgage
becomes binding once the contract is signed. The Hanbali scholars elaborate on this
issue by stating: When someone mortgages an asset which is already in the hands of
the mortgagee, whether the mortgagee has obtained such asset through borrowing,
on trust basis, or forcibly etc, the mortgage is valid, because the asset is owned by
the mortgagor and can be possessed, hence, it can be mortgaged, as if it is in =

It is permissible for the Institution to retain investment accounts and in-

common property which is permissible as has been indicted earlier in this
standard. Permissibility of such mortgages can also be based on the fact that
an investment account or unit usually comprises cash, or assets, or debts,
or most often a mixture of all that. As we have seen earlier mortgaging of
any of these items is permissible. Furthermore, mortgaging of investment
accounts and units can be seen as similar to mortgages that comprise a for-
givable degree of gharar, due to the changing nature of real assets as a com-

by Imam Ahmad is that the mortgage here becomes binding by virtue of the same

According to Al-Qadi and his companions as well as Al-Shafii the mortgage does
not become valid without the elapse of sufficient time for possession, Shamsul-Din
 has
Al-Insaf  has
(Ibn Qudamah), Al-Sharh Al-Kabir
(Ibn Qudamah),
also discussed this issue and added mortgaging of an asset held by the mortgagee
on the basis of a nullified contract (Ala` Al-Din Al-Mardawi, Electronic copy: Al-
Jami  Al-Kabir  Program).  An  important  point  to  be  noted  here  is  what  has  been
quoted  in
  on  the  discussion  about
Al-Sharh  Al-Kabir  on  the  discussion  about
quoted  in  Mukhtasar  Al-Insaf 
the  status  of  the  mortgagee  who  is  already  holding  the  asset  on  guarantee  basis.
The quoted statement comprises the following: When someone mortgages an asset
which is already seized or borrowed by the mortgagee, the mortgage is valid and
the guarantee of the mortgagee is cancelled according to Malik and Abu Hanifah.
Al-Shafiee said that the guarantee should not be cancelled and the mortgage is valid
because there is no contradiction between the two. According to Al-Shafiee even
in the mortgage arrangement the mortgagee is committed to guarantee in case of
transgression. To me, the mortgagee has the right to hold the asset as a mortgage
and he is no longer to be seen as a transgressor, yet the assertion that there is no
contradiction between holding the asset as a mortgage on the one hand, and holding
it through borrowing or seizure on the other, is objectionable, because a borrower or
someone who takes the asset by force has to guarantee the asset whereas a mortgagee
is supposed to keep the asset on trust basis rather than under guarantee. Moreover,
on mortgaging the asset there will remain no reason which justifies continuation of
the guarantee. If the mortgagee is to be held responsible later on for transgression
against  the  mortgaged  asset,  that  will  be  for  his  transgression  rather  than  for  his
status as a borrower or someone who has taken the asset by force, Muhammad Ibn
Abdul-Wahhab,

reason  which  necessitates  it.  That  is  to  say  relaxation  of  guarantee  because  of
mortgage is overruled by a Shariah requisite for guarantee because of borrowing or
seizure; contrary to the case of on-trust deposit (Wadiah) where there is a Shariah
prohibition against guarantee. Regarding the same issue of mortgaging an asset that
is already in the hands of the mortgagee, the following has also been stated by Fiqh
scholars when the mortgaged asset is already in the hands of the mortgagee such as
a borrowed or an extorted asset, the mortgage is valid and the guarantee is cancelled
according to Malik and Abu Hanifah. Al-Shafiee argues that the guarantee should
not be cancelled and the mortgage is valid because there is no contradiction between
the two. According to Al-Shafii even in the mortgage arrangement the mortgagee
is  committed  to  guarantee  in  case  of  transgression,  and  therefore  the  mortgage  is
valid along with the guarantee.; Shamsul-Din (Ibn Qudamah),

Shafii that there is no contradiction between holding the asset as a mortgage on the
one hand, or holding it through borrowing or seizure on the other. Ibn Qudamah

Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  Standard  covers  investment  accounts  managed  on  the  basis  of
Mudarabah  and  the  principles  and  conditions  of  realization  and
entitlement to profit. The Standard also covers how profits are to be
distributed  between  the  institution  as  a  Mudarib  and  the  holders  of
investment accounts as Arbab al-Mal, and to discuss the procedural
aspects of profit realization such as determination of the expenses to be
charged to investment accounts and the allocations and reserves to be
deducted from the profits. The standard does not cover the accounts
managed  on  the  basis  of  investment  agency  because  such  accounts
require a separate standard.
2. Investment Accounts (Demand Deposits)
2/1  Definition and types of investment accounts
  These  are  the  amounts  which  the  institution  receives  from  inves-
tors  on  the  basis  of  participatory  Mudarabah  (al-Mudarabah  al-
Mushtarakah). The holders of such accounts delegate the institution
to invest their funds through Mudarabah. Investment accounts can be
divided into two types. The first type is investment accounts that are
managed on the basis of unrestricted Mudarabah where the Mudarib
is delegated to invest the Mudarabah funds in any field of investment
he deems suitable. The second type is investment accounts which are
managed on the basis of restricted Mudarabah, where the Mudarib
has to invest the Mudarabah funds in a specific type of investment to
be determined by Rab al-Mal (owner of the capital). The relationship
between the holders of these accounts and the institution is the typical
relationship  between  the  Mudarib  (the  work  provider)  and  Rab  al-
Mal.Mal.
994994
Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
2/1/1 Unrestricted investment accounts
These are the amounts received from investors who authorize
the institution to invest their funds on the basis of Mudarabah
without restricting the investment of such funds to a specific
project  or  investment  program.  The  holders  of  the  accounts
and the institution share the profit, if any, according to the ratio
specified for each of them either in the Mudarabah contract or
in the application for opening the account. The holders of the
accounts bear all the losses in proportion to their respective
shares in the capital, except losses arising from transgression,
negligence or breach of the contract, which have to be borne
by the institution.
2/1/2 Restricted investment accounts
These are the amounts whose owners authorize the institu-
tion to invest them on the basis of Mudarabah in a specific
project or investment program(2)(2). The holder of the account
project or investment program
. The holder of the account
and the institution share the profit, if any, according to the
ratio  specified  for  each  of  them  either  in  the  Mudarabah
contract or in the application for opening the account. The
holder of the account bears all the losses in proportion to his
share in the capital, except losses arising from transgression,
negligence or breach of contract, which have to be borne by
the institution.
2/1/3 Equality in investment opportunities
In  principle,  equality  in  investment  opportunities  should  be
ensured  between  shareholders  funds  and  the  funds  of  the
holders of the investment accounts in participatory Mudarabah.
In case a different policy is to be adopted, the institution should
disclose that before disposition, with due consideration to the
relevant regulatory restrictions and the conditions of opening
the accounts.
 Restricted investment accounts can be managed on the basis of investment agency.
(2)(2) Restricted investment accounts can be managed on the basis of investment agency.

Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
2/2  The  difference  between  an  investment  account  and  a  current
account and its likes
2/2/1 The current accounts are the amounts which the institution
receives  from  clients  who  are  not  seeking  investment.  Such
amounts represent loans which the institution has to guarantee
their  repayment  on  demand  without  any  increment.  The
institution has the right to dispose of such amounts and invest
them  for  its  own  benefit  and  under  its  own  responsibility,
preferably after indicating this in the application for opening
the account.(3)(3) As regards investment accounts, these are the
the account.
 As regards investment accounts, these are the
amounts  deposited  with  the  institution  on  trust  basis,  and
hence  the  institution  is  not  committed  to  guarantee  their
repayment,  except  in  case  of  transgression,  negligence  or
breach of the contract.
2/2/2  The institution should guarantee full repayment of the amounts
of  the  current  accounts  to  their  holders,  whereas  it  should
not  assume  the  commitment  to  pay  any  fixed  or  variable
increment on the principal amounts of such accounts, because
such payment constitutes usurious interest. The institution is
not  committed  to  guarantee  investment  accounts.  It  is  only
committed to distribute their profit or loss among their holders
as per the ratios agreed upon.
2/2/3 Saving accounts which carry no authorization for investing
them to the benefit of their holders shall become subject to
the rulings on current accounts, whereas those which carry
such  authorization  shall  become  subject  to  the  rulings  on
investment accounts.
2/2/4 The institution may charge fees (commissions) for the services
of  opening  investment  accounts.  Such  fee  has  to  be  a  lump
(3)(3) For more rulings on current accounts as regards, for instance, charging fees for keeping
 For more rulings on current accounts as regards, for instance, charging fees for keeping
such accounts or distribution of prizes to them see Shariah Standard No. (19) on Loan
(Qard).

Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
sum amount which should preferably not exceed the average
actual cost, and should be charged once at the time of opening
the account.
2/2/5 In case of depositing coins or paper money by handing them
over to the cashier the institution may charge a fee for trans-
portation,  storage  and  counting  of  the  deposited  amounts.
This,  however,  does  not  include  amounts  transferred  to  the
account of the institution.
2/2/6 In transference of money between accounts constructive pos-
session  is  sufficient,  whether  for  the  same  currency  or  dif-
ferent currencies, because the process involves exchange and
transference.  [see  Shariah  Standard  No.  (1)  on  Trading  in
Currencies]
2/2/7 The  funds  which  the  institution  fails  to  transfer  to  owners
because  of  change  of  address  shall  be  kept  in  a  suspended
account  for  the  specified  period  before  being  added  to  the
charity account. If the addresses of the owners of such funds
came  to  be  known  later  on  the  funds  should  be  paid  out  to
them from the charity account. In this regard, a clause should
be added to the conditions for opening the accounts indicating
that the holders of the accounts agree to donate for charitable
purposes any amounts which could not be transferred to them
within a specific period due to change of address.
2/2/8 In principle, the institution should resort, through exchange
of  correspondence,  to  holders  of  the  accounts  when  there  is
any change in the conditions or profit sharing ratios. However,
due  to  the  difficulty  and  cost  involved  in  such  process  the
institution  may  send  notifications,  or  advertise  the  new
changes  in  its  website  so  that  the  implicit  acceptance  of  the
concerned  parties  is  obtained  if  no  protest  is  received  from
them within a specific period. The changes in question, which
shall  become  effective  starting  from  the  beginning  of  the
next period, should be incorporated in the conditions of the
997997
Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
accounts,  with  due  reference  to  the  procedure  followed  for
their adoption.
2/2/9 It  is  permissible  to  stipulate  the  authoritative  status  of  the
documents and financial statements of the institution, unless
such documents and statements are proved to be wrong by
the  accountholder.  If  dispute  arises  the  two  parties  should
resort to experts, arbitration or law.
2/2/10  The cost of proving the accusation shall be borne by the accoun-
tholder when he files the claim against the institution.
3. Realization of Profit
  Realization of distributable profits should be subject to the following:
3/1  Safety of the capital
3/1/1 Realization of profit in investment accounts does not take place
before protecting the capital. Any amount of profit distributed
before ensuring such protection is considered as an advance
payment, rather than realized profit [see item 5/3]. The profit
authorized for investment at the end of the investment period
is considered as part of the capital in the next period.
3/1/2 Actual and constructive liquidation
Realization  of  profit  in  investment  accounts  does  not  take
place before the following steps:
3/1/2/1 Liquidation  of  Mudarabah  assets,  which  can  be  either
actual liquidation where all the assets are converted into
cash and all debts are collected, or it can be
constructive
cash and all debts are collected, or it can be constructive
liquidation where, in addition to cash amounts, noncash
assets  are  valued  by  experts,  along  with  valuation  of
all  debts  with  regard  to  possibilities  of  collection  and
appropriate allocations for bad debts.
3/1/2/2  Covering of the following expenses:
a)  Expenses  relating  to  utilization  of  the  balances  of
the investment accounts by charging each operation
with the direct expenses incurred in its execution.
998998
Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
b)  The share of the balances of the investment accounts
from shared expenses, excluding expenses relating
to the institutions own activities.
Investment accounts should also not be charged with
the expenses of the tasks which have to be performed
by the Mudarib. Such expenses include the expenses
of the investment departments and the bodies which
endorse their decisions as well as the expenses of the
follow-up  and  accounting  departments.  It  is  also
permissible  to  specify  a  ceiling  for  the  expenses
above which all the expenses are to be borne by the
Mudarib.
3/1/2/3 Deduction of the allocations and reserves relating to the
investment, from investment income so as to arrive at
distributable profit. In this case, allocations for bad debts
and reserve for rate of returns have to be deducted from
gross profit, whereas reserve for investment risks has to
be deducted after deduction of the Mudaribs share.
3/2  In realization of the profit the following should be observed
3/2/1 When loss is incurred in one Mudarabah operation it can be
covered from the profits of other operations, and if it exceeds
the  profits  it  should  be  covered  from  capital.  What  should
really  matter  is  the  final  result  of  liquidation  at  the  end  of
the  financial  period  specified  by  the  institution.  The  loss  of
a  certain  financial  period  should  not  be  covered  from  the
profits of another period, except in the case of covering losses
from reserves.
3/2/2 Due  to  the  fact  that  unrestricted  investment  accounts  of
continuous  participatory  Mudarabah  lack  coincidence  in
the beginning and end of the process of depositing funds in
the  accounts,  the  profit  from  the  operations  which  extend
to  succeeding  periods  has  to  be  distributed  over  the  whole
period  of  such  operations  in  proportion  to  the  duration  of
each operation.
999999
Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
4. Entitlement to Profit
4/1  The  method  of  profit  distribution  should  be  well  known  so  that
no room is left for uncertainty and dispute. Distribution of profits
should also be in terms of ratios, and not at all by specifying a lump
sum amount or a percentage of the capital for any party, or any other
method that could lead to avoidance of sharing of the profit between
the two parties.
4/2  Specification  of  profit  ratios  for  the  two  parties  should  not  be
postponed beyond the time of signing the contract. When the two
parties do not specify such ratios at the time of signing the contract
normal practice can be sought - if any - as when, for instance, profit
is  normally  shared  on  equal  basis.  If  there  is  no  normal  practice
to  resort  to  the  Mudarabah  contract  becomes  null  and  void,  the
Mudarib is entitled to the wage normally paid for similar work, and
the whole profit goes to Rab al-Mal.
4/3  The institution can specify different ratios for distribution of profits
between  itself  and  different  categories  of  holders  of  investment
accounts,  or  it  can  specify  a  unified  ratio  for  all.  The  ratios  for
distribution of profits among the holders of the investment accounts
can also be unified or varying on the basis of certain weights.
4/4  When one of the two parties stipulates a lump sum amount for himself
the  Mudarabah  contract  becomes  null  and  void.  This  restriction,
however, does not include the case when the two parties agree that
if the profit exceeds certain limit or index the excess amount should
be taken by one of them. If the profit is at that limit/index or below
it shall be shared as agreed upon between the two parties.
4/5  It is impermissible to earmark the profit of a specific type or portion
of the capital or the assets into which capital is converted, for one
of the two parties. It is also impermissible to allocate the profit of
a certain financial period or a specific transaction for one party, and
the profit of another financial period or a specific transaction for the
other.
10001000
Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
4/6  The method agreed upon for distribution of profit can be fixed for
the  whole  period,  or  variable  according  to  specific  sub-periods  of
partial liquidation.
4/7   When the Mudarib mixes the Mudarabah funds with his own funds,
he becomes a partner by subscribing his funds and a Mudarib for the
Mudarabah funds of the other party. In this case the profit has to be
divided between the two amounts of capital, so that the Mudarib can
get the profit of his work as well as the profit of his funds as a partner.
The profit share of the Mudarib as a partner shall become subject
to  the  same  treatment  of  the  shares  of  the  holders  of  investment
accounts. [see item 4/3]
4/8  In principle, the profit belongs to the institution and the holder of
the account, yet the two parties can agree on allocation of a certain
part of the profit to the benefit of a third party. [see Shariah Standard
No. (13) on Mudarabah, item 8]
4/9  It is permissible for the accountholder to exit from the Mudarabah
with  all  his  funds  or  part  of  them.  Such  exit  represents  the  desire
of the accountholder to redeem his share in the Mudarabah assets
without withdrawing the total amount deposited in his account or
part of it. It is permissible for the institution in this case to specify
the amount relating to the exit so that it can earn no profit, or less
than  the  profit  it  would  have  earned  in  the  absence  of  exit.  Such
arrangement  constitutes  exit  on  the  basis  of  supply  and  demand,
rather than deprivation from profit.
4/10  The  ratios  of  the  amounts  deposited  in  the  investment  accounts
which the institution retains for liquidity purposes  may be stated
in the conditions of the accounts - has to be treated as follows:
4/10/1 The case could be that the bank never invests such amounts
because they are withheld in the accounts of the central bank
or  the  banks  treasury  for  the  sake  of  meeting  requests  for
withdrawal from investment accounts, hence there is no re-
turn for which a ruling can be indicated here.
10011001
Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
4/10/2 Or  the  case  may  be  that  the  bank  utilizes  such  funds  in
short  term  or  easy-to-liquidate  investments  so  as  to  cater
for applications
for withdrawal from investment accounts -
for applications for withdrawal from investment accounts -
although  the  bank  sometimes  stipulates  in  the  conditions
such  funds  are  allocated  for  liquidity
of  the  accounts  that  such  funds  are  allocated  for  liquidity
of  the  accounts  that
purposes. In this case it is permissible for the bank to invest
such funds without obtaining the consent of the holders of the
accounts, because the bank is authorized for any disposition
that serves the interest of the two parties of the unrestricted
Mudarabah  contract.  When  a  return  is  earned  from  such
investment  it  should  be  added  to  the  investment  base.  The
holders of the account will be entitled to a share in this profit
in their capacity as Arbab al-Mal, and the bank is entitled to
its share as a Mudarib, subject to the ratios agreed upon. If,
instead,  a  loss  is  incurred  from  investment  of  the  amounts,
without any transgression or negligence from the side of the
bank,  it  should  be  borne  by  the  holders  of  the  accounts  in
their capacity as Arbab al-Mal.
5. Distribution of Profit
5/1  Application of scoring method of profit distribution:
  With due consideration to items 4/3 and 4/4, the scoring method for
for
  With due consideration to items 4/3 and 4/4, the scoring method
distribution of profit among the participants of general
investment
distribution of profit among the participants of general investment
accounts can be used. Such method takes into account the amount
contributed  by  each  investor  and  the  period  of  its  stay  in  the
investment  (currency  unit  x  time  unit).  Each  account  is  given
a certain number of scores depending on its amount and the period
of  stay  of  that  amount  in  the  investment  even  if  depositing  and
withdrawal have repeatedly been done and the amount varied from
time to time. The holders of the accounts are considered to have
implicitly exchanged mutual relief from commitment (Mubara`ah)
for any aspects that practically cannot be catered for.
5/2  There  is  no  prohibition  against  setting  an  expected  rate  of  return
which is not considered to be binding if not achieved, even if it is
10021002
Shariah Standard No. (40): Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-Based Investment Accounts
reached  through  a  feasibility  study.  However,  final  distribution
of  profits  should  be  based  on  realization  of  profit  after  actual  or
constructive liquidation, rather than on such expected rate of return.
5/3  It is permissible to pay advance amounts to the holders of the accounts
settlement can
before actual or constructive liquidations so that final settlement can
before actual or constructive liquidations so that final
be made later on. After actual or constructive
liquidation the institution
be made later on. After actual or constructive liquidation the institution
is  committed  to  make  necessary  additions  to,  or  deductions  from,
the advanced amounts so that each holder of an investment account
receives his exact share of the profit.
5/4  Mutual relief from commitments (Mubara`ah) in case of exit should
be stipulated in the contracts of the Mudarabah-based investment
accounts.  The  stipulation  should  indicate  that  the  exiting  party
reliefs the holders of the accounts (the depositors) from commitment
towards  his  rights  in  any  undistributed  or  non-apparent  profit,  as
well as his rights in the remaining part of the reserves for investment
risks  and  rate  of  return,  and  the  remaining  part  of  allocations  for
debts. Similarly, the stipulation should state that the holders of the
accounts  relief  the  exiting  party  from  commitment  towards  any
losses that have not yet become apparent. The stipulation should also
indicate  that  on  liquidation  of  the  investment  base  the  remaining
parts  of  the  above  mentioned  reserves  and  allocations  shall  be
devoted to charitable purposes.
5/5  Institutions should liquidate Mudarabah and distribute the realized
profit  between  the  Mudarib  and  the  holders  of  the  investment
accounts according to the conditions of the Mudarabah contract.
5/6  When  the  shareholders  in  their  capacity  as  the  Mudarib,  decide  -
after liquidation of the Mudarabah and preparation of the profit and
loss account - to relinquish part of their profit share to the benefit of
the accountholders, the institution should disclose that.

It is impermissible in Mudarabah to specify the return for any of the two
parties in terms of a lump sum amount or a certain percentage of the capital,
because  such  specification  eliminates  profit  sharing  which  constitutes
a fundamental aspect of the Mudarabah contract. By such specification,
the very essence of partnership will be lost when, for instance, the profit
earned is just equal to the lump sum amount or percentage of the capital
earmarked for one party.

the most equitable method of accounting in hand that can be used for
assigning profit shares commensurate to the amounts and their periods
of  stay  in  the  accounts.  However,  entering  into  investment  on  such
basis necessitates mutual relief from commitments (Mubaraah) among
investors with regard to any part of entitlement that could not be catered

takes  into  consideration  what  should  be  done  by  the  Mudarib  for  the
sake of carrying out his investment decisions on receipt of the funds, and
his commitment to do the work which entails having the bodies required
for that purpose. A resolution to this effect has also been issued by the Al
Baraka Seminar (4/1).

  Impermissibility of charging interest for loans is based on the fact that
such charge constitutes Riba. In this regard the international Islamic Fiqh
Academy issued its resolution No. (10/2) stipulating that whether such
increment is charged for postponement of a defaulted debt, or as an in-
terest on the loan stipulated since the time of signing the contract, both
increments are forms of Shariah-prohibited Riba.
Impermissibility of postponing specification of profit ratios for the two
  Impermissibility of postponing specification of profit ratios for the two
Mudarabah parties until the profit is earned is based on the fact that such
postponement leads to Jahalah (ignorance) which could lead to dispute.

a right that the two parties may permissibly exercise.

Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers Islamic reinsurance and participation with tradi-
tional insurance or reinsurance companies. The Standard does not cover
Islamic insurance which has already been covered in a separate standard.
2. Definition of Reinsurance
2/1  Islamic  Reinsurance  refers  to  the  agreement  among  insurance
companies, on behalf of the insurance funds under their management,
to  devise  a  mechanism  for  the  avoidance  of  part  of  the  risks
which  the  insurance  funds  may  encounter.  On  the  basis  of  such
agreement a reinsurance fund which has a distinct legal personality
and  independent  financial  liability  is  formed  up  through  making
contributions  out  of  the  insurance  funds  paid  by  the  insurance
clients on the basis of donation. The reinsurance fund, thus formed,
assumes the task of covering part of the risks encountered by the
insurance funds.
2/2  Reinsurance, as described above, constitutes the Islamic alternative
for the reinsurance provided by traditional reinsurance companies,
which  is  based  on  exchange  of  the  reinsurance  premiums  and
compensation, rather than on donation commitments.
3. Shariah Status of Reinsurance
3/1  Shariah status of Islamic reinsurance:
3/1/1  It is permissible to reinsure with Islamic reinsurance companies.
3/2  Shariah status of reinsurance with traditional reinsurance companies:
It is impermissible for Islamic insurance companies to reinsure with
traditional reinsurance companies, except when such reinsurance is
sought  as  a  transitional  arrangement  stemming  from  public  need
which amounts to necessity.
10181018
Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
4. Key Methods of Reinsurance
  With regard to the scope of commitment of the reinsurer, reinsurance
can take place through one of the following two forms:
4/1  Selective reinsurance: In this case the insurance company presents
the individual risk which constitutes the subject matter of reinsurance
to the reinsurer along with a summary of all the information related
to  it,  so  that  the  reinsurer  can  study  the  information  and  decide
whether to accept the risk or not. The reinsurance company (insurer)
becomes committed to what it accepts.
4/2  Comprehensive  reinsurance  (reinsurance  agreement):  In  this  case
the reinsurance company assumes the commitment to accept all the
risks which fall within the scope of the agreement signed with the
insurance company.
5. Key Forms of Reinsurance Requests
5/1  Risk sharing reinsurance: The insurance company in this case seeks
reinsurance for a percentage of the insurance policies it issues (50%
or  25%),  whether  such  coverage  is  within  or  in  excess  of  its  own
insurance capacity.
5/2  Excess  risk  reinsurance  (beyond  risk  tolerance):  The  insurance
company keeps all the insurance policies which it can easily tolerate
their risks and seeks reinsurance for those which involve risks that it
cannot tolerate.
5/3  Loss reinsurance: According to this type of reinsurance the reinsurance
company assumes the responsibility of bearing the losses beyond the
specific limit agreed upon. This form of reinsurance is widely used in
the insurances which involve big amounts. The insurance company
bears, for instance, the first 20 thousand dollars of compensation for
the accident, while the reinsurance company bears the rest.
6. Controls on Reinsurance with Traditional Reinsurance Companies
In reinsuring with traditional reinsurance companies, Islamic insurance
companies should observe the following controls:
10191019
Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
6/1  Islamic  insurance  companies  should  reinsure  first  with  Islamic
reinsurance companies, to the largest possible extent.
6/2  Islamic insurance companies should not keep any cash reserves for
ongoing risks, that belong to traditional reinsurance companies and
on which interest has to be paid. Nevertheless, an agreement can be
reached between the Islamic insurance company and the traditional
reinsurance  company  in  order  to  specify  a  certain  portion  of  the
premiums  payable  to  the  traditional  reinsurance  company  to  be
retained by the Islamic insurance company. The Islamic insurance
company can invest retained funds through Mudarabah or investment
agency,  where  the  Islamic  insurance  company  assumes  the  role  of
the  Mudarib  and  the  traditional  reinsurance  company  assumes
the role of Rab al-Mal. When profit is distributed as per the ratios
agreed upon, the share of the traditional reinsurance company is to
be added to its account with the Islamic insurance company, whereas
the share of the profit earned by the Islamic insurance company for
performing  the  investment  as  an  independent  personality  is  to  be
added to the account of the participants.
6/3  The periods of the reinsurance agreements sought by Islamic insur-
ance companies from traditional reinsurance companies should be
commensurate to the actual need.
6/4  Before signing agreements with traditional reinsurance companies, Is-
lamic insurance companies should seek the approval of their Shariah
Supervisory Boards.
6/5  Islamic insurance companies should stick to the minimum size of
reinsurance  with  traditional  reinsurance  companies,  and  Shariah
Boards should undertake follow-up in this connection.

Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
7/2  It  is  impermissible  for  an  Islamic  insurance  company  to  receive
reinsurance commission from a traditional reinsurance company.
Nevertheless, the Islamic insurance company has the right to seek
premium discounts from the traditional reinsurance company.
7/3  Islamic insurance companies should not accept any redistributions of
insurance surplus forwarded by traditional reinsurance companies.
Nonetheless,  Islamic  insurance  companies  can  request  premium
discounts from traditional reinsurance companies.
8. Shariah  Controls  on  Practicing  Islamic  Reinsurance  by  Islamic
Reinsurance Companies
 8/1 Islamic reinsurance companies should observe the Shariah controls
on the activities of Islamic insurance companies indicted in Shariah
Standard No. (26) on Islamic Insurance, with due consideration to
the fact that the participants in this case are the insurance companies.
8/2  Formation of a Shariah Supervisory Board to supervise the process of
establishing the Islamic reinsurance company, verify its contracts and
documents, overview its applications and submit Shariah reports on
its activities.
8/3  It  is  permissible  for  the  Islamic  reinsurance  company  to  provide
reinsurance services to traditional insurance companies, subject to
the following conditions:
1.  The contract to be used should be the Islamic reinsurance con-
tract.
2.  There should be no linkage.
3.  Reinsurance should not involve a Shariah prohibited object.
9. Financial Gains Received from Islamic Reinsurance Companies
  All  financial  gains  which  Islamic  insurance  companies  receive  from
Islamic reinsurance companies are considered as lawful gains and should
be credited to the account of policyholders (the participant companies of
the reinsurance scheme), as part of revenues.

Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
and Prophetic Hadiths which instruct people to cooperate. In this regard,
a number of resolutions have been issued by the Islamic Research Academy
of  Al-Azhar  in  addition  to  the  Resolution  of  the  Islamic  Fiqh  Academy
-Makkah Al-Mukarramah and Resolution No. (9) 9/1 of the International
Islamic Fiqh Academy which states: Indeed, the contract which respects
the origins of Islamic dealings is the cooperative insurance contract which
is  based  on  donation  and  cooperation  Moreover,  permissibility  of
cooperative  insurance  contract  has  never  encountered  dispute  from  any
contemporary Fiqh scholar.(5)(5)
contemporary Fiqh scholar.
In  addition  to  what  has  been  stated  above,  the  underlying  reasons
for  permissibility  of  solidarity  reinsurance  and  impermissibility  of
commercial reinsurance can be summarized in the following essential
differences between the two systems:
a) The commercial reinsurance company is an exchange-based financial
contract which aims to make profit out of the reinsurance itself, and
therefore  should  become  subject  to  the  rulings  on  exchange-based
financial contracts which can be affected by Gharar. In the contrary,
in  solidarity  reinsurance  the  contract  is  based  on  donation  and
cooperation and thus cannot be affected by Gharar when the contract
involves it.
b) The  company  in  the  Islamic  reinsurance  contract  is  an  agent  of
the  reinsurance  account,  whereas  in  commercial  reinsurance  the
company  is  a  principal  party  who  signs  the  contract  in  his  own
name.
c) The  company  in  commercial  reinsurance  owns  the  reinsurance
premiums against commitment to pay the reinsurance amount, while
in Islamic reinsurance the company does not own the contributions,
which are owned by the reinsurance account.
d) In Islamic reinsurance the remaining part of the contributions and the
returns  on  it  -after  expenses  and  compensations-  go  to  the  account
of the policyholders (such amounts represent the surplus distributed
among participants), whereas this cannot be imagined in commercial

Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
reinsurance, because the contributions are owned by the company by
virtue of the contract and through actual possession. The contributions
in the case of commercial reinsurance are even considered as revenue
and profit.
e) In  Islamic  reinsurance  the  returns  earned  from  investment  of  the
principal  amount  of  the  contributions  go  to  the  account  of  the
policyholder after deduction of the Mudaribs share by the company,
whereas in commercial reinsurance such returns go to the company.
f) Islamic reinsurance aims to achieve cooperation among the participa-
ting companies rather than profit, whereas commercial reinsurance
aims to achieve profit from the reinsurance process itself.
g) In Islamic reinsurance the company makes profits by investment of
its funds in addition to its share in the Mudarabah, as it assumes the
role of the Mudarib and the reinsurance account assumes the role of
Rab al-Mal.
h) In Islamic reinsurance companies the participant and the reinsurance
client are in fact the same person even if legally considered as separate
personalities, while in commercial reinsurance companies they are
completely different.
i)  An  Islamic  reinsurance  company  observes  the  rules  of  the  Islamic
Shariah  and  the  Fatwas  issued  by  its  Shariah  Supervisory  Board,
whereas the case is not so for commercial reinsurance companies.
j)  When the allocations deducted from the solidarity reinsurance fund
remain unpaid until the time of liquidation they are spent on chari-
table purposes and are not given to the participants, whereas in com-
mercial reinsurance companies such funds go to participants.
  The Islamic reinsurance contract is considered as a binding donation
The Islamic reinsurance contract is considered as a binding donation
contract, because it is analogous to Munahadah (contribution of travelers
to  a  pool  of  food  victuals)  or  to  pledge  of  donation.  Both  of  the  Islamic
Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League and the International Islamic
Fiqh Academy stipulated in their resolutions referred to earlier that Islamic
reinsurance is based on donation.

  The  fact  that  the  Islamic  reinsurance  contract  is  binding  can  also  be
The  fact  that  the  Islamic  reinsurance  contract  is  binding  can  also  be
derived from what has been emphasized by Imam Malik about donation.
According  to  Imam  Malik  a  gift  in  general  becomes  valid  before
possession, and this was also said to have been the viewpoint of Ali and
Ibn Masood. The Hanbali scholars hold that a gift is binding even if it is
not possessed, except in things that are measured in terms of volume and
weight.(6)(6) Ibn Rushd (the grandson) said: Scholars were in disagreement
weight.
 Ibn Rushd (the grandson) said: Scholars were in disagreement
regarding possessionMalik said: The contract is valid on acceptance,
and possession of the gift should be enforced quite like the case in sale(7)(7)

Bakar  and  Omar  considered  the  gift  to  be  binding  only  when  it  is
possessed.(8)(8) Therefore, Malik seems to have taken all these viewpoints
possessed.
 Therefore, Malik seems to have taken all these viewpoints
into consideration. He derived from the viewpoint of Ali, Ibn Masood
and the others that the contract as such is binding, whereas he took the
viewpoint of Abu Bakar and Omar to mean that possession is a necessary
condition for completion of the contract so as to leave no room for the
Dhariah (excuse) mentioned by Umar.(9)(9)

for  this  important  aspect  of  the  company.  In  the  absence  of  emphasis  on
these  principles  which  distinguish  Islamic  reinsurance  from  commercial
reinsurance,  Islamic  reinsurance  may  become  an  exchange-based  reinsu-
rance contract, and hence becomes vulnerable to nullification by Gharar, as
has been indicated earlier. For illustration of these distinguishing principles
of  Islamic  reinsurance,  several  Fatwas  have  been  issued  including:  Fatwa

ties in addition to the special nature of the insurance contract with regard

The reinsurer and the client should honor their commitments because
the reinsurance contract is binding to both parties. According to Shariah,
the  two  parties  should  honor  what  they  agree  upon  as  long  as  it  does
not contradict with the rules and principles of Islamic Shariah. This can
be derived from the Quranic Verses and Hadiths which instruct people
to  observe  commitments  and  conditions  they  agree  upon,  including

Appendix (C)
Definitions
Reinsurance
The reinsurance contract is a contract according to which the insurance
company transfers part of the risks of its insurance commitments to the
reinsurance  company.  The  insurance  company,  therefore,  undertakes  to
pay  to  the  reinsurance  company  part  of  the  insurance  premium  paid  by
the participants, against commitment of the reinsurance company to bear
part  of  the  claims  as  per  an  agreement  between  the  two  parties.  Islamic
reinsurance has the distinctive characteristic of being based on the same
principles  of  solidarity  insurance,  as  indicated  in  Shariah  Standard  No.
(26) on Islamic Insurance.
Special Need
Something that concerns a certain group of people, or the employees
of  a  certain  profession,  as  for  instance  the  need  for  insurance  for  the
employees in trade and industry sectors.
Public Need
Something that does not concern a certain group of people, or a certain
country. Public need is the need that concerns everybody such as the need
for Istisnaa.
Reinsurance Commission
A  percentage  amount  of  the  contributions  payable  to  the  reinsurance
company, paid to the Islamic insurance company for the efforts it exerts in
mobilizing the reinsured insurance contracts.
Reinsurance Profit Commission
A percentage amount of the realized increase of revenues over expenses
in  the  reinsurance  agreement,  paid  to  the  Islamic  insurance  company  as
10341034
Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
a bonus for its excellent performance in managing the insurance operations
in general, and the reinsured risks in particular.
Risk-Sharing Reinsurance
The process of sharing the insured risk between the Islamic insurance
company and other insurance companies, either due to lack of sufficient
insurance capacity for such risk, or because of regulatory requirements of
risk sharing with regard to the magnitude of the risk in question.
Financial  Gains  of  Islamic  Insurance  Companies  from  Traditional
Reinsurance Companies
Reinsurance  agreements  between  traditional  reinsurance  companies
and Islamic insurance companies lead to the following financial gains to
Islamic insurance companies:

a bonus for its excellent performance in managing the insurance ope-
rations in general and the reinsured risks in particular, and providing
the best services to its customers. Such amount is paid in the form of
an agreed upon percentage of the profits of the reinsurance company,
as per the reinsurance agreement signed between the two companies.
When  the  reinsurance  company  earns  profits  from  the  reinsurance
contracts signed between the two companies, the reinsurance company
pays the part of the profits agreed upon to the insurance company.

Appendix (D)
A Model Reinsurance Agreement Issued
by Islamic Insurance Company  Jordan
1. The insurance company agrees with the reinsurance company on signing
annual agreements with the aim of transferring part of the risk borne by
the insurance company, to the reinsurance company.
2. The insurance company assumes beforehand commitment to transfer to
the reinsurer the agreed upon part of the reinsured risk, and the reinsurer
offers  his  acceptance.  According  to  the  conditions  of  the  reinsurance
agreements, the commitment of the reinsurer becomes valid since the
time of signing the original insurance contract with the insurance client.
3. The insurance company assumes the commitment to pay the reinsurance
contribution against the commitment of the reinsurer to pay its share of
the claims, in addition to the commissions agreed upon for the contracts
within the signed agreements. It can also be stipulated in the agreement
that the insurance company shall obtain a share in the profits achieved by
the reinsurer under the signed agreements.
4. The insurance company retains a percentage of the reinsurance contribu-
tions (40%) for fire agreements, general accidents and marine and health
insurance, as a guarantee for honoring commitments from the side of the
reinsurer. The amount thus retained is to be released after one year within
the reinsurance agreement. During the period of its retention, the amount
is to be invested with the Islamic Bank of Jordan through Shariah-accept-
able modes of investment, and the reinsurer be given the part of the return
agreed upon.
5. The return thus obtained by the reinsurer becomes part of his accounts,
and is deductable from the commissions to be received from him, on the
10361036
Shariah Standard No. (41): Islamic Reinsurance
basis of the fact that such amount is part of the cost of the reinsurance
operation.
6. The reinsurer assumes the commitment to pay commission to the insurance
company. Such commission is determined as a certain percentage of the
reinsurance contributions. This amount does not represent a commission
in the strict sense of the word. It is rather a contribution from the part of
the reinsurer in the direct expenses borne by the insurance company, and
which relate to the reinsured risks.
7. Such commissions enter into the accounts of policyholders as part of
revenues in the account of the cooperative insurance fund.
8. The reinsurance agreement normally stipulates the right of the insurance
company to obtain a specific percentage of the net profits achieved by the
reinsurer under the reinsurance agreement.
9. Reinsurance profit commission is calculated at the end of the agreement
period, and enters into the accounts of the policyholders as part of reve-
nues.

Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard provides a description of financial rights, their types, rules,
conditions, parameters, the way they are exercised and transferred and the
mechanisms used to protect them. It also addresses the most important
rights exercised in the transactions of financial institutions.
  This Standard does not cover non-financial rights; Khiyarat
  This Standard does not cover non-financial rights;
 (options to
Khiyarat (options to
terminate a contract); e.g.,
 (an option stipulated by the
Khiyar al-Shart (an option stipulated by the

parties giving one or both of them the right to revoke the contract within
  (an  option  giving  the
Khiyar  al-Naqd  (an  option  giving  the
a  specified  period  of  time)  and  Khiyar  al-Naqd
a  specified  period  of  time)  and
seller the right to revoke the contract for non-payment within a specified
time etc.); or rights relating to Waqf (endowments), as they have already
been covered in separate standards.
2. Definition of Financial Rights
  A  financial  right  is  the  prerogative  of  a  (natural  or  artificial)  person
recognized  by  the  Shariah  to  have  rights  and  responsibilities  and  the
legal capacity to enter into transactions.
3. Types of Financial Rights
  Financial rights are of three types:
3/1  Personal rights (rights in personam): These are rights arising from
the liability of another person, such as debts payable by a debtor.
3/2  Proprietary rights (rights in rem): These are rights attached to specific
property  conferring  to  the  owner  direct  authority  over  it  without
interference from another person, whether such rights are primary
or secondary.
3/2/1 Primary proprietary rights, such as rights arising from full and
complete ownership, are independent rights that do not rely
on the existence of any other right.
10441044
Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
3/2/2 Secondary proprietary rights; these are proprietary rights that
have no purpose of their own except to protect the fulfillment
of personal rights, such as the rights of a creditor in security
provided by an obligor.
3/2/3 The distinction between proprietary and personal rights: The
owner of a proprietary right is able to directly enforce his right
to  specific  property  using  permissible  means.  The  owner  of
a personal right, on the other hand, cannot enforce his right by
claiming any specific property.
3/3  Rights to intangible assets:
3/3/1  These  are  financial  rights  to  intangible  assets,  whereby  the
owner is exclusively entitled to their output.
3/3/2 Types of rights to intangible assets: Rights to intangible assets are
of many kinds, including rights to trade name, trading addresses,
trademarks, commercial licenses; intellectual property, technical
and industrial know-how, patents and copyrights.
3/3/3 Rules governing rights to intangible assets:
3/3/3/1 Rights to trade names, trading addresses, trademarks,
copyrights, inventions and patents are the rights of their
respective  owners.  These  possess  recognised  monetary
value in contemporary business and commercial custom.
Since  these  rights  are  recognised  and  protected  by  the
Shariah , it is not permissible to violate them.
3/3/3/2  Since  rights  to  intangible  assets  are  recognised  as  fi-
nancial rights, it is permissible to dispose of or transfer
them for consideration provided that such transactions
are free of Gharar (ambiguity), deception and fraud.
3/3/3/3 Commercial license: A commercial license is a right
given by the relevant authority to certain businesses to
engage in specified activities. It is permissible for the
license holder to dispose of it for or without consider-
ation unless specifically prohibited by law.
10451045
Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
3/4  Financial rights can be acquired by contract, stipulated conditions,
inheritance  or  court  order.  Financial  rights  may  be  established  by
long-standing continuous use without objection or first use subject to
fulfillment of all the Shariah conditions required for the acquisition
of such rights.
4. Rights Resulting from Ownership
4/1 Ownership of an asset or usufruct gives the owner the right of complete
disposition, either by a complete transfer or the transfer of usufruct
only, for or without consideration, except what is prohibited by the
Shariah.
4/2 Ownership of usufruct entitles the owner to use it (whether directly
or  indirectly  through  another  person)  subject  to  compliance  with
the terms stipulated by the owner of the asset and bearing liability
for the asset in case of misuse, negligence or breach of condition.
4/3 Ownership of a license to use gives the licensee the right to personal
use only which cannot be transferred to a third party.
5. Easements
5/1  Private easements are established rights attached to one real estate
property over another, such as irrigation rights, watercourse rights,
drainage rights and rights of passage.
5/2  Public easements are the rights of the general public to benefit from
public utilities provided by the state and similar entities.
5/2/1 The right of an individual to a public easement is restricted to
personal use only.
6. Financial Rights Arising from Neighbourhood
6/1  The  rights  of  neighbourhood  based  on  the  ownership  of  different
floors of a building prohibit each owner to act in a manner that will
definitely or most likely cause harm to others.
6/2  Since the owners of different floors of a building co-ownership in
the underlying land, the following apply:
10461046
Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
6/2/1 If a lower storey collapses due to any fault of its owner, he is
liable to reconstruct it so that the owners of the upper-storeys
are not harmed.
6/2/2 If  the  owner  of  the  lower  storey  is  not  responsible  for  the
collapse, the courts have decisive authority to settle the matter
in  the  best  interests  of  both  parties  and  to  avert  harm  from
them.
6/2/3 The owners have the right to enjoy use of common facilities
and services.
7. Right of Shuf ah (Preemption)
7/1  Definition  of  Shuf a  (preemption):  Shuf a  is  the  right  given  to
a neighbour or co-owner of real estate property to acquire a sold
property from its buyer with or without their consent for the price
at which it was sold.
7/1/1 The right of Shuf ah exists only in relation to immovable prop-
erty or movable property attached to it.
7/1/2 The right of Shuf ah enjoyed by a neighbour is applicable only
when the two properties share common easement rights.
7/2 Rules of Shuf ah
7/2/1 The Shafi (preemptor) takes the place of the buyer and, subject
to  circumstances  being  equal,  enjoys  the  right  to  purchase
the property on the same terms as contracted with the buyer,
such as deferred payment. The Shafi (preemptor) assumes all
also the liabilities of the buyer such as the usual conveyancing
costs.
7/2/2 If in a jointly owned property, there are more than one Shu-
faa`(preemptors), each has the right of Shuf ah proportionate
to his share in the property.
7/2/3 Rights  of  Shuf a  are  not  extinguished  upon  the  death  of  the
Shafi (preemptor) but are inherited by his heirs.
10471047
Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
7/2/4  Rights of Shuf ah must be claimed immediately upon becoming
aware of the sale in accordance with custom or law, failing which
they lapse.
7/2/5  The Shafi (preemptor) is entitled to invalidate all the dispositions
of the preempted property that were made prior to the exercise
of the right of Shuf ah , even if it has changed hands.
7/2/6  There is no right of Shuf ah where ownership is transferred without
a sale or a transaction having the effect of a sale. Therefore, there
is  no  right  of  Shuf ah  where  transfer  is  effected  by  inheritance,
bequest or gift without consideration.
8. Right of Occupancy
  Occupancy is a right based on the right of the tenant to retain his tenancy
in property or commercial unit.
  Occupancy has a number of forms:
8/1  The  Shariah  does  not  prohibit  the  owner  and  the  tenant  agreeing
that the tenant will pay a lump sum of money over and above the
periodic rental amount, on condition that it is considered part of the
agreed rent for the entire lease period. If the lease is terminated early,
the rules applicable to rental payments apply to this amount.
8/2  It is permitted by the Shariah for the owner and the tenant to agree
during  the  lease  period  that  the  owner  will  pay  an  amount  to  the
tenant  in  exchange  of  the  tenant  waiving  his  contractual  right  to
the ownership of the usufruct for the remaining period on the basis
that  such  payment  compensates  the  tenant  for  waiver  of  his  right
to the usufruct that he purchased from the owner. However, if the
lease period expires and the contract is not renewed, either expressly
or by operation of a provision for automatic renewal, then it is not
permitted to take payment for vacating the premises, and the owner
has the right to take back his property after expiry of the term.
8/3  The Shariah permits an agreement between the incumbent tenant and
a new tenant during the lease period to assign the lease for an amount
exceeding the regular rental amount for release of occupancy subject
to the requirements of the terms and conditions of the original lease
10481048
Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
contract and applicable laws that are compliant with the rules of the
Shariah.
In  long-term  lease  contracts,  contrary  to  contractual  terms  that
are based on what is permitted by the laws of some jurisdictions,
the Shariah does not permit the tenant to sub-lease or assign the
property to another tenant in return for payment except with the
agreement of the owner.
If  the  incumbent  tenant  agrees  to  hand  over  occupancy  to  a  new
tenant after the end of the lease period, the Shariah does not permit
him to take any payment because the right of the incumbent tenant
in the usufruct has expired.
9. Right of Tahjir
9/1  Tahjir means taking possession of a piece of land and marking it with
certain recognised markers with the permission of the government.
9/2  Tahjir results in exclusivity and priority over others, but it does not
on its own confer ownership.
9/3  A person who has carried out Tahjir on a piece of land is permitted to
waive his entitlement in favour of another person for consideration,
but he is not allowed to sell the land as he does not yet own it.
9/4  The right of Tahjir expires if the land is not utilised for three years,
or as provided by applicable regulations.
10. Transfer of Rights for Consideration
10/1  It is not permissible to take consideration for transfer of put or call
option rights, whether by means of sale or otherwise.
10/2 It is not permissible to take consideration for transfer or waiver of
rights granted only to prevent harm, such as the right of Shuf ah
(preemption).
10/3 It is permissible to take consideration for transfer or waiver of
easement rights, by means of sale or otherwise.
10/4  It is permissible to sell rights to use and rights arising from first
use.use.

Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
11. How Rights Are Exercised and Transferred
11/1  All financial rights are in principle disposable, and the owner of
a financial right has the absolute right to exercise and transfer his
right in accordance with the rules and principles of the Shariah
and in particular, the following:
11/1/1 Rights should not be exercised in a manner abuse to others.
11/1/2 The public interest is given priority when it conflicts with
the exercise of a private property right.
11/2 Subject to the provisions of this Standard, the constructive methods
of  disposal  of  rights  include  all  types  of  contracts  of  exchange,
donations, waivers, partnerships, and assignments of rights. [see
Standard No. (7) on Hawalah]
12. Protection of Rights
12/1 Rights are to be protected from any violation.
12/2 In  addition  to  the  provisions  of  Shariah  Standard  No.  (5)  on
Guarantees, the methods of protecting financial rights include:
a) Rights do not extinguished by passage of time but there can be
a limitation period after which a claim cannot be made in court.
b) Right  of  lien:  A  creditor  has  the  right  to  retain  the  debtors
property already in his possession until he receives payment
of the due debt from the debtor. This may take several forms:
I. The right of the seller to retain the sold item until he receives
the due price.
II. The right of a manufacturer or worker to retain the product
of their work until they receive the payment due.
III. The right of the lessor to retain the lessees property inside
the  leased  asset  until  he  receives  the  rent  due,  because  the
lessor has possession of the leased asset which contains the
lessees property.
 IV. The right of a courier to retain the dispatched property until
he receives his fees.

VI. The right of an agent to retain the property of the principal

c)  If  the  buyer  of  an  item  becomes  insolvent  and  the  seller  finds
that specific item in the insolvency assets, the seller has a priority
proprietary right to it if the applicable regulations of a jurisdiction
allow it. Refer to Shariah Standard No. (43) on Insolvency.
13. Some Rules Governing Contemporary Applications of the Transfer
and Exercise of Financial Rights
13/1  It is permitted for corporate bylaws to give existing shareholders
priority over third parties to subscribe for shares upon a decision
to increase the companys share capital. Each shareholder is entitled
to subscribe in proportion to his respective share prior to the share
issuance.
13/2  It is permissible to assign a right of priority referred to in item 13/1
to a third party without consideration, subject to the provisions of
the law and the rules of company supervisory bodies.

The basis for the invalidity of a condition stipulating that the seller retains
ownership in a sale contract is that the transfer of ownership is a legal
effect of the sale contract. Therefore, it is not permissible for a sale to take
place without it. This has also been stressed in Resolution No. (51) 6/2
of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy held in Jeddah, which states:
The seller is not entitled to retain ownership of the sold item after the
sale, but it is permissible for him to stipulate a condition on the buyer to
retain possession of the item as security against deferred installments.

Appendix (C)
Definitions
Right of Easement
It is the established right over one piece of real estate for the benefit of
another piece of real estate.
Right of Irrigation (Shirb)
Shirb literally means a share in water. The Shariah definition is a turn to
irrigate land or trees or crops.
Right of Watercourse (Majra)
It is the right of an owner of land distant from a watercourse to bring it
via the property of his neighbour to his land to irrigate it.
Right of Drainage (Masil)
It is the right of a person to get rid of excess water in his property via
the property of another person. Watercourse is different from drainage in
that watercourse is in order to bring water whereas drainage is to get rid of
water not needed for the land.
Right of Way Easement (Murur)
It is the right of the owner of an interior piece of land (land surrounded
by other persons lands) to access his land by means of a road/path. It makes
no difference if the road/path is public, not owned by anyone, or is privately
owned by someone.
Right of Ascendancy (Taalli)
The right of ascendancy means one persons right to have his structure
be physically located above the structure of another person. This happens
in multi- storey buildings in which one person owns a unit in a lower storey
and another owns a unit in the storey above it.
10581058
Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
Preemption
Preemption in the terminology of jurists means the entitlement of the
partner to buy what his partner has sold for the price at which he sold it.
Intangible Rights
Intangible right is the authority of a person over something that is ab-
stract, e.g., ideas and inventions. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy,
headquartered in Jeddah, issued its Resolution No. (43) 5/5 on the subject
of intangible rights, which include; Trade Name, Title, Trademark, Author-
ship, and Invention. The Academy considered these to be rights particular
to their respective owners which have established financial value. Conse-
quently, these rights are recognized by the Shariah and they should not be
violated.
Right of Utilization (Intifa)
The  right  of  utilization  is  a  juridical  concept  that  refers  to  a  persons
temporary right over the asset of another person, who authorizes him to use
it, exploit it, and dispose of its usufruct, but not the asset itself, during the
period of utilization. The majority of jurists, including the Shafiis, Malikis
and Hanbalis, distinguish between the ownership of usufruct (Manfaah)
and  ownership  of  utilization  (Intifa).  Granting  ownership  of  utilization
(Intifa)  only  allows  a  person  to  directly  utilise  [the  asset].  Granting
ownership of usufruct (Manfaah) is more general and comprehensive; it
allows its owner to use the asset himself or to enable others to use it, either
for compensation, as in a lease, or without compensation, as in gratuitous
lending of the asset.
Right of Exclusive Lease (Hikar)
Hikar is the right to lease the land of an endowment for a long period
of  time.  The  Mustahkir  (exclusive  lessee)  makes  an  advance  payment
to  the  endowment  which  is  nearly  equal  to  the  price  of  the  land  that
is  used  to  develop  it  or  for  the  maintenance  of  its  premises.  Another,
insignificant, amount is arranged to be paid annually to the endowment
by the Mustahkir (exclusive lessee) or by whosoever this right has been
transferred to.
10591059
Shariah Standard No (42): Financial Rights and How They Are Exercised and Transferred
Right of Priority in Subscribing to an Increase in a Companys Capital
It is the stipulation that the existing shareholders will have the right of
priority in subscribing to an increase in the companys capital by purchasing
shares at their nominal value
Vacating Houses or Shops
It refers to the right to stay in a house or shop.
Business License
It is a right granted by the authorities to some traders to deal in specific
activities.
Right of Demarcation
It  means  taking  possession  of  a  piece  of  land  and  marking  it  with
markers or a wall. Demarcation confers privilege and precedence over
others. It means that whosoever demarks land is more entitled to develop
it; however, it does not confer ownership.
Disposal
Disposal is the competence approved by the Shariah , or custom, or law
that enables the owner of rights to dispose of them. This disposal can either
be by transferring his right to others for recompense; e.g., sale or barter, or
without recompense; e.g., gift, will, or by relinquishment.
Abusive Use of a Right
It the use of a right in such a way that it is likely to cause serious extraor-
dinary harm to another.
Expiry
It is the lapse of a right due to the passage of time. However, in the Sharih,
rights do not lapse due to the mere passage of time.

that  precede  it,  whether  they  are  faced  by  the  institutions,  companies  or
individuals,  both  businessmen  and  non-businessmen,  with  whom  financial

Shariah Standard No (43): Insolvency
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  Standard  covers  the  Shariah  rules  relating  to  the  causes  and
consequences  of  insolvency,  whether  faced  by  an  institution  or  its
institutional or individual business and non-business customers. It also
addresses the judicial declaration of insolvency over an institution and
its consequences, and in particular, the sale of its assets, the distribution
of the proceeds among the creditors and how insolvency is revoked.
It does not cover financial difficulties
(as defined by Islamic jurisprudence),
It does not cover financial difficulties (as defined by Islamic jurisprudence),
liquidity shortfalls or delays in payment that do not lead to a declaration
of insolvency.
2. Definitions of Insolvency and the Declaration of Insolvency
Insolvency (Iflas): When the debt due of a person exceeds his assets.
  Declaration of insolvency (Taflees): A judges declaration that a debtor is
insolvent, preventing him from disposing of his assets.
3. Shariah Ruling on Insolvency
3/1  A  person  whose  debts  exceed  his  assets  has  a  moral  obligation  in
Shariah to refrain from any action that may harm the creditors, even
if he has not been declared insolvent.
3/2  The competent authorities should declare a person insolvent when his
debts exceed his assets and sequester his assets if his creditors demand
it, subject to the conditions mentioned in item 4/3.
3/3 When  a  debtor  is  declared  insolvent,  the  declaration  must  be
documented and certified as required by official procedures.
4. Stages of Insolvency
4/1  First stage: The creditors make a demand upon the debtor to pay
the debt due to the creditors pro-rata and to refrain from making
10661066
Shariah Standard No (43): Insolvency
donations,  providing  loans  or  disposing  of  or  acquiring  assets
preferentially. The creditors can seek the assistance of concerned
authorities in this regard.
4/2  Second stage: If the debtor refuses to pay what he owes to the creditors,
the creditors are entitled to file a claim against him as a step towards
seeking a declaration of insolvency. They can petition the competent
authorities to seek to:
4/2/1  Prevent the debtor from making donations;
4/2/2  Prevent the debtor from providing loans;
4/2/3  Prevent  the  debtor  from  giving  preferential  treatment  (for
example to certain creditors or in the disposal or acquisition
of assets);
4/2/4  Prevent the debtor from admitting financial liability to those
who may be the subject of preferential treatment such as his
blood  relatives  connected  by  up  to  four  vertical  steps  (for
example,  a  first  cousin,  who  is  connected  vertically  via  the
grandparents); and such as affiliates, subsidiaries and group
entities of institutions;
4/2/5  Prevent the debtor from pre-paying debts that are not yet due;
4/2/6  Prevent  the  debtor  from  transferring  any  of  his  assets  to
some of the creditors or selling to or purchasing from them
preferentially; and
4/2/7  Prevent the debtor from travel that causes harm to the creditors
without appointing a surety to ensure his attendance if required,
providing guarantors.
4/3  A declaration of insolvency requires:
4/3/1  An  application  made  by  creditors  demanding  that  a  debtor
whose  due  debts  exceed  his  assets  be  declared  insolvent,
subject to item 5/5; or
4/3/2  An application made by the debtor himself, except when the
competent  judicial  authority  considers  his  application  to  be
fraudulent.
10671067
Shariah Standard No (43): Insolvency
4/4  The creditors are not required to prove that they are the sole creditors.
If another creditor appears before the distribution, he is entitled to
a  pro-rata  share  of  the  distribution.  If  a  creditor  appears  after  the
distribution, the rule set out in item 8 shall apply subject to statutory
procedures so long as they are not inconsistent with the rules and
principles of Shariah.
4/5  The court has the sole authority to declare a person insolvent.
5. 5. Consequences of Insolvency
Consequences of Insolvency
   Declaration of a debtors insolvency gives rise to the following conse-
quences:
5/1  An admission by a debtor, who has been declared insolvent, of any
liability to another person relating to his sequestered assets has no
legal effect, whether such admission relates to a debt incurred before
or after the declaration of insolvency, unless the creditors accept that
such debt was incurred before the declaration of insolvency.
5/2  The debts owed to creditors are attached to the existing property of
the debtor at the time of sequestration as well as to any property that
accrues  to  him  without  his  dealing,  such  as  gifts.  All  his  property
remains in his ownership until it is determined that such property
be sold and that the proceeds be distributed among the creditors.
5/3  The  debtors  acts  of  sale,  gift  or  endowment  subsequent  to  the
declaration of insolvency have no legal effect, with the exception of
acts relating to previous transactions, such as terminating a defective
contract and exercising an option to terminate. Such lack of legal
effect  applies  during  the  period  of  uncertainty  that  precedes  the
declaration of insolvency, as assessed by the competent authority.
5/4  After  declaration  of  insolvency,  all  the  debtors  subsequent  acts  of
sale,  purchase,  admission  (of  liability)  or  guarantee,  are  attached
to  his  future  liability  and  not to  the sequestered assets. He can be
to  his  future  liability  and  not  to  the  sequestered  assets.  He  can  be
required to discharge such subsequent liabilities after revocation of
the sequestration. Those whose rights attach to his liability are not
entitled to share the sequestered assets with the creditors.
10681068
Shariah Standard No (43): Insolvency
 5/5/1 All of the debtors undue debts become due despite the creditors
of  such  undue  debts  having  no  present  right  to  demand
a declaration of his insolvency. The creditors of undue debts are
entitled to share the sequestered assets with the creditors of due
debts.
5/5/2 If  the  lessee  becomes  insolvent  during  the  Ijarah  term,  the
lessor  shall  be  entitled,  on  a  pro-rata  basis  along  with  other
creditors, to the amount of rent corresponding to the period
during  which  the  usufruct  was  enjoyed.  For  the  remaining
period,  the  lessor  shall  have  the  option  either  to  terminate
the Ijarah contract or to carry on with it so that he has claims
on the insolvency assets for the rent of the remaining period,
while  enabling  the  lessee  to  enjoy  the  usufruct  unless  the
court considers continuity of the Ijarah to be in the interest of
creditors, in which case the lessor shall receive the rent amount
in full.
5/6  It is permissible, with the approval of the creditors, to agree to reduce
undue  debt  that  was  accelerated  by  the  declaration  of  insolvency
and guarantors are liable to pay the reduced amount, rather than the
amount originally guaranteed.
5/7  Undue debts owed to the insolvent debtor do not become due upon
insolvency; all outstanding debts owed to the insolvent debtor before
the declaration of insolvency (even if not yet due) are included in the
insolvency assets (and are distributed to the creditors as and when
they are paid).
5/8  After distribution, creditors have no legal right to demand any unpaid
debt from the debtor. However, the debtor has a moral obligation in
Shariah to pay all the debts in full.
6. Right of Claw-Back of an Item Sold to the Debtor Prior to the Declaration
of Insolvency (the Right of Claw-Back)
  The right of claw-back gives a creditor who sold an item to the insolvent
debtor the right to demand return of the specific item if it is among the
10691069
Shariah Standard No (43): Insolvency
sequestered  assets  or  to  have  claims  on  these  assets.  This  right  shall  be
established for the seller who has not received any part of the selling price.
7. Sale of the Sequestered Assets and Allowances Made for the Insolvent
Debtor
7/1  The  concerned  authorities  will  order  the  sale  of  the  sequestered
assets  -other  than  the  assets  described  below-  whether  they  are  in
currencies different to the currency in which the insolvency is being
administered, fungibles, stocks, commodities (goods or merchandise)
or real estate. A reasonable period of time should be allowed before
selling  real  estate  assets,  and  assets  should  be  sold  in  the  order
provided above. A survey of market prices should be conducted to
ensure  that  a  better  price  could  not  be  achieved  at  auction.  If  the
price  offered  is  less  than  the  value  of  the  asset,  the  auction  should
be repeated to obtain the value of the asset. Otherwise, it should be
sold at whatever price is achieved on the third auction. If possible, it
is recommended to make the sale subject, for a reasonable period of
time, to an option to reverse the sale.
7/2  Excluded  from  the  sale  are  the  insolvent  debtors  tools  of  trade;
whatever  he  needs  to  continue  his  business;  a  suitable  home  and
basic expenses for him and his dependents. If his home exceeds his
requirements, it should be sold and replaced by one that is suitable
for him. The same applies mutatis mutandis to institutions.
7/3  The debtor is not required to earn or take out a loan if the proceeds
of sale are not sufficient to pay off his debts.
8. Distribution of the Insolvent Debtors Assets Among the Creditors
8/1  It is preferable to expedite the distribution but not with such excessive
haste that it harms the insolvent debtor. It is not necessary to delay
the  distribution  until  all  insolvency  assets  are  sold.  The  proceeds
may be distributed as and when they are received, which is required
if  the  creditors  demand  it,  taking  into  consideration  the  statutory
procedures of insolvency provided that they do not conflict with the
rules and principles of the Shariah are observed.
10701070
Shariah Standard No (43): Insolvency
8/2  The judge should start the distribution with assets that are of the
same denomination as the debt.
8/3  The following order should be observed during distribution:
8/3/1 Priority should be given to paying the fees of the administrators
and  their  assistants  who  manage  the  process  of  sale  and
distribution.
8/3/2 Next in order should be secured creditors, as per the rules of
granting security.
8/3/3  Non-employee  contractors  (such  as  tradesmen)  and  lessors  of
transport  vehicles  are  entitled  to  declare  a  lien  over  any  of  the
insolvent debtors property in their possession in order to recover
their  full  fees  from  the  insolvency  assets,  and  such  property
reverts to the insolvency assets once the fees are paid.
8/3/4 A  person  who  finds  a  specific  item  of  his  property  in  the
insolvency assets has a preferred claim over it. Such property
may include safety deposits, portfolios, investment funds, the
capital of Mudarabah or investment agency, and the share of
a  non-insolvent  partner  in  a  partnership  managed  by  the
institution declared insolvent and the insolvency assets in the
case of an insolvent partner.
8/3/5 The rest should be distributed among the creditors, with each
creditor receiving an amount pro-rata to his share of the total
debt.
8/3/6 If a debt is discovered after the distribution, the new creditor
should  obtain  his  share  from  each  of  the  existing  creditors,
either by mutual consent or through litigation.
9. Rules Specific to Institutions
9/1  The following items are included in the insolvency assets:
9/1/1 Current accounts held with the institution, because these are
liabilities of the institution which must be borne by it alone and
which should not be borne by the investment accountholders;
10711071
Shariah Standard No (43): Insolvency
9/1/2 All debts outstanding against the institution.
9/2  Investment vehicles that are independent of an (insolvent) institution
in  their  fund  sources  and  revenues  are  not  part  of  the  insolvency
assets. Such investment vehicles include restricted deposits, funds,
 assets that are not wholly or partially owned by
Sukuk assets that are not wholly or partially owned by
portfolios and Sukuk
portfolios and
the institution and in which the institutions responsibility is limited
to managing on a paid agency or Mudarabah basis.
9/3  Any  assets  held  by  the  institution  as  custodian,  such  as  securities
belonging to third parties and safety deposit boxes, are not part of
the insolvency assets.
10. Revoking the Declaration of Insolvency
10/1  Upon distribution of the insolvent debtors assets to the creditors,
the declaration of insolvency is revoked by the court and announced
according to the requirements of convention or statute.
10/2  After the declaration of insolvency is revoked, if an asset is discovered
that came into the ownership of the insolvent debtor prior to the
declaration of insolvency without reciprocal consideration, such as
a gift, it is sequestered to be distributed among the creditors whose
debts  were  outstanding  before  the  declaration  of  insolvency.  If
statute restricts applications for a declaration of insolvency unless
after expiry of a limitation period, the outstanding debt remains
a liability of the debtor based on morality/religious credence.
10/3 If the insolvent debtor enters into a credit transaction after revo-
cation  of  his  declaration  of  insolvency  and  then  owns  property
through  new  transactions,  and  is  thereafter  declared  insolvent
a  second  time,  the  creditors  of  the  first  insolvency  are  not  enti-
tled to a share of the assets of the second insolvency. If however,
the new property came into his ownership without reciprocal con-
sideration, such as a gift, the creditors of the first insolvency are
entitled to a share of the assets of the second insolvency based on
morality/religious credence.

The basis for the requirement that the insolvency should be demanded by
the owners of due debts is that there is no demand (warranted) for undue

The basis for the attachment of new dispositions to the liability of the in-

a commitment.

The basis for the view that gives the creditor the right to reclamation -a view
accepted by the Malikis, Shafiis, Hanbalis and some of the earliest scholars

related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim(3)(3) that affirms the right to recourse for the
related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim
 that affirms the right to recourse for the
seller when he finds the exact commodity with the insolvent buyer. He has
the option to take it or to leave it and become a partner of the creditors in the
distribution of the price. It is subject to the following conditions:
a)  The insolvent should be alive at the time of recourse. In the case of
an institution or company, it should remain existent.
b)  The insolvent remains liable for all of the compensation due. If the
seller has received part of it, he will be given an option regarding the
remainder.
c)  The  whole  asset  should  remain  in  the  ownership  of  the  insolvent.
If all or part of it has been destroyed, or if it has left his ownership
through sale, or gift, or endowment, the right to reclamation will be
cancelled regarding the remaining part except when the transaction
involves multiple parties.
d) The  asset  should  not  be  in  a  condition  where  it  is  mingled  with
something from which it cannot be distinguished, nor can its cha-
racteristics have changed to the point that the original name for it
no longer applies or that its value has been reduced.

e) The  right  of  another  person  should  not  relate  to  it,  e.g.,  when  the
insolvent  has  pledged  it  as  security,  except  when  the  owner  of  the
right (the mortgagee) renounces his right to the mortgage.
    The  right  to  reclamation  is  the  cancellation  of  the  sale.  It  can  take
place  verbally  or  by  a  substitute  means.  It  takes  place  immediately
and does not need the decision of a judge, or the knowledge of the
competent authority, or the ability to deliver.
    Besides  that,  if  the  asset  or  its  value  or  its  feature  decreased,  or
an inseparable increase occurred in it, like an increase in the weight
of livestock, and he chose reclamation, he will only have that. But if
the increase is separate, it would belong to the insolvent.
    The right to reclaim land is not precluded by any building built on it
by the insolvent nor by any trees he planted on it. The creditor will
be given an option between having the insolvent remove the building
and the trees, with the creditor bearing liability for any damage (to
what  is  moved),  or  taking  the  building  and  trees  and  paying  their
price. In case of cultivated land, the crop will remain until harvest,
free of any charge.

The basis for the other view, which does not recognize the right to recla-
mation, is that the Hadith related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim contravenes
the implication of a Shariah principle; i.e., the liability of the insolvent
remains operative and the creditors right regarding that liability remains
stable. This group cited the Hadith:
Anyone who died or went insolvent,
stable. This group cited the Hadith: Anyone who died or went insolvent,
and some of his creditors found exactly their property, they are on a par
with the other creditors.(4)(4)

Shariah Standard No (44): Obtaining and Deploying Liquidity
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  Standard  covers  what  is  meant  by  liquidity  and  the  permissible
means of obtaining and deploying it.
2. Definition of Liquidity and Liquidity Management
2/1  Liquidity refers to cash or that which can be easily converted to cash.
2/2  Liquidity management means achieving a balance between obtain-
ing  liquidity  as  swiftly  and  cheaply  as  possible  and  investing  and
deploying it effectively.
  Liquidity  is  achieved  in  various  ways  depending  on  where  it  is
being utilised. For example, in institutions it is the ability to cover
withdrawals; in the money market it is the ability to swiftly convert
securities into cash; and with Sukuk and investment funds, it is the
ability to redeem or sell them in the secondary market.
3. Need to Utilise Liquidity in Institutions
Institutions need liquidity to meet numerous requirements, such as:
3/1 To distribute profits, which may rely on the liquidation of assets, see
Shariah Standard No. (40) on Distribution of Profit in Mudarabah-
Based Investment Accounts.
3/2 To discharge liabilities by selling inventory assets and converting them
to cash to pay what is owed to creditors, to face contingent liabilities,
or liquidate investment vehicles or the institution itself, and similarly
to expand its activities, or to achieve capital adequacy or to improve
its credit rating, see Shariah Standard No. (43) on Insolvency.
4.  Obtaining and Deploying Liquidity
4/1  Obtaining and deploying liquidity through interest-bearing loans is
prohibited by the Shariah, whether transacted directly or through
10881088
Shariah Standard No (44): Obtaining and Deploying Liquidity
overdrafts  or  interest-bearing  or  commission-based  facilities.  Any
liquidity support made available by supervisory or regulatory bodies
(such  as  central  banks)  must  be  provided  only  through  Shariah-
compliant modes, such as Mudarabah and investment agency.
4/2  Permissible modes of obtaining liquidity include:
4/2/1 Selling  commodities  on  a  Salam  (deferred  delivery)  basis,
receiving payment up-front, and then purchasing the relevant
commodities for delivery on the maturity date. It is permitted
to  secure  a  promise  to  sell  (from  a  third  party  commodity
broker)  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  fluctuation  between  the  sale
price and purchase price. [see Shariah Standard No. (10) on
Salam and Parallel Salam]
4/2/2 Istisnaa concluding an Istisnaa-based sale contract stipulating
advance  payment  -although  advance  payment  is  not  obliga-
tory- and concluding a parallel Istisnaa-based purchase con-
tract stipulating deferred or installment payment. [see Shariah
Standard No. (11) on Istisnaa and Parallel Istisnaa]
4/2/3 The institution selling some of its assets for immediate cash
and then, if required, leasing the asset back on rent payable
in  arrears,  taking  into  consideration  what  has  been  stated
in  Shariah  Standard  No.  (9),  item  5/8,  on  Ijarah  and  Ijarah
Muntahiah Bittamleek.
4/2/4 Financing working capital to expand the institutions activities
This involves the institution inviting investors to participate in
financing its working capital on a Mudarabah or Musharakah
basis for a specified period of time determined by its liquidity
requirements and with the ability to liquidate the Mudarabah
or Musharakah at the end of such period. The investors enter
into  the  Mudarabah  or  Musharakah  by  contributing  their
capital  while  the  institution  contributes  its  current  assets,
after valuation, as its share of the capital of the Musharakah or
Mudarabah. The institutions fixed assets do not form part of
10891089
Shariah Standard No (44): Obtaining and Deploying Liquidity
the Musharakah; rather, fixed assets are either lent or leased to
the venture and rental payments are accounted as expenses of
the Mudarabah or Musharakah.
4/2/5 Issuing investment Sukuk to expand the institutions activities
This involves issuing the types of investment Sukuk explained
in Shariah Standard No. (17) on Investment Sukuk in order
to obtain funds from Sukuk investors and undertake projects
required of the institution. The institution may securitise some
of its assets by selling them to Sukuk subscribers, managing
the assets on their behalf and promising to purchase them at
the market price or at a price to be agreed. If the institution is
only the lessee and not the manager of the Sukuk assets, it may
promise to purchase them at face value.
4/2/6 Tawarruq
This should be done in accordance with Shariah Standard No.
(30) on Tawarruq.
4/2/7 Interest-free loan
An  application  of  interest-free  loans  is  outlined  in  Shariah
Standard No. (26) on Islamic Insurance in item 10/8 regarding
loans given by the Takaful operator to the Takaful fund.
5. Liquidity Should Only Be Deployed Using Shariah-Compliant Modes,
which include:
5/1  Purchasing commodities in cash and selling them for deferred payment
through Musawamah or Murabahah contracts.
5/2 Leases, lease contracts that end in ownership and forward leases,
whether for tangible assets or services.
5/3  Purchasing commodities on a Salam basis (immediate payment for
deferred  delivery),  then  selling  them  after  taking  physical  or  con-
structive delivery, whether personally or by appointing the seller, in
a separate contract, to sell the commodities to his customers.
10901090
Shariah Standard No (44): Obtaining and Deploying Liquidity
5/4  Istisnaa and parallel Istisnaa, which involve the institution commis-
sioning the manufacture of products or projects on an Istisnaa basis
with immediate payment for deferred delivery upon completion and
then selling the same manufactured products to a third party through
a  second  Istisnaa  contract  for  deferred  price  and  delivery,  without
linking  the  two  contracts,  or  procuring  the  sale  by  appointing  the
manufacturer as an agent, through a separate contract, to sell the man-
ufactured product or project to his customers.
5/5  Musharakah  and  Mudarabah  which  involve  the  institution  as  the
capital provider.
5/6  Investment agency, which involves the institution appointing another
institution or those with whom it deals to act as its agents.
5/7  Subscription to purchase Shariah-compliant stocks, investment Sukuk
or shares in investment funds.
5/8  International commodity trading in the financial markets in accordance
with Shariah.
5/9  Currency trading in accordance with Shariah.

Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  The basis for the definition of liquidity as referring to cash and whatever
The basis for the definition of liquidity as referring to cash and whatever
is easily converted into cash is that the traditional terminology for liqui-
dity  is  Tandid  (literally,  to  convert  to  cash),  actually  or  by  estimation.
Actual Tandid means converting commodities into cash by selling them.
Tandid by estimation means evaluating commodities in order to arrive at
the expected monetary value that can be realized from them.
  The basis that profit distribution depends on the availability of liquidity
The basis that profit distribution depends on the availability of liquidity
is that there cannot be any profit except after the protection of the capital,
and this protection is realized by liquidating the assets.
   The basis for the prohibition of procuring liquidity through interest-based
The basis for the prohibition of procuring liquidity through interest-based
loans is the prohibition of any type of Riba (usury). The supervisory bodies
are the entities most responsible for overseeing that the institutions liquidity
is compliant with Sharia h. This is because it is these bodies that have licensed
the institutions to operate by Shariah-compliant procedures and prohibited
them from that which violates the Shariah.
The basis for the Shariah-compliant methods of obtaining liquidity is pro-

Definitions
Diversification of Liquidity
The deployment of liquidity in various instruments; for example, purchas-
ing short-term, medium-term and long-term Sukuk to protect investments

Liquidity Surplus
The availability of liquidity exceeding the institutions needs.
Liquidity Deficit
The need for liquidity in order to meet financial requirements.
Good Liquidity
It is based on two principles: The best price and the shortest period for
obtaining it.

  This Standard covers the instruments and methods used to protect capital
and investments from loss, decrease and destruction.
2. Definition of Capital and Investment Protection and the Difference
Between Protection and Guarantee
  Protection  of  capital  and  investments  means  using  available  methods
to prevent loss, decrease or destruction. It is wider than a guarantee of
invested capital, as a guarantee is an undertaking by a particular party to
bear any loss, decrease or destruction of the capital. On the other hand,
protection refers to the safeguarding of capital.
3. Shariah Ruling
3/1  Protecting capital by permissible means is desirable in Shariah as it
serves the objectives of Shariah with regard to wealth.
3/2  It is compulsory for an investment manager, whether he is a Mudarib,
an investment agent or a managing partner, in his fiduciary capacity,
to exercise due diligence to protect the funds from loss, decrease or
destruction. If he fails to do so using usual means of protection, he is
liable (for loss), taking into consideration items 4/1 and 7/1.
3/3  It is permissible to use Shariah-compliant instruments and processes
to protect investment from risks that it may be exposed to whether
they are risks relating to a loss of capital, depreciation in value,
inflation,
they are risks relating to a loss of capital, depreciation in value, inflation,
or the fluctuation of exchange rates, etc.
3/4  The investment manager acts in a fiduciary capacity with regard to
the  funds.  He  is  not  liable  for  loss  of  capital  except  in  case  of  his
wilful  misconduct,  negligence  or  breach  of  contractual  terms  and
conditions.
11021102
Shariah Standard No. (45): Protection of Capital and Investments
3/5  The efforts exerted by the investment manager to grow the capital
must be suitable for the nature of the relevant investment. It is also
incumbent  on  him  to  take  professional  measures  that  normally
provide  suitable  protection  for  the  funds.  Otherwise,  he  will  be
deemed negligent.
3/6  It is not permissible to stipulate in an investment agreement that the
investment manager is unconditionally liable for any loss of capital
in  cases  other  than  willful  misconduct,  negligence  and  breach  of
contractual terms and conditions.
3/7  If a loss occurs caused by the Mudaribs wilful misconduct, negligence
or  breach  of  contract,  the  capital  provider  may  hold  the  Mudarib
liable  for  the  loss  of  capital  but  not  the  loss  of  profit.  However,  if
it is determined through actual or constructive liquidation that the
investment accrued profit which was added to the capital and then
suffered a loss due to the Mudaribs wilful misconduct, negligence
or breach of contract, the Mudarib is liable to idemnify for loss of
that  profit  as  it  has  become  a  part  of  the  capital.  If  destruction  of
the whole or a part of the capital is caused by the Mudaribs wilfil
misconduct, negligence or breach of contract, the Mudarib is liable
for the value of the capital.
Shariah Compliant Means for Protecting Capital
4.4. Shariah Compliant Means for Protecting Capital
4/1  Instruments and processes used to protect capital and investments
must fulfill the following conditions:
4/1/1  The  investment  partners  should  bear  the  risks  and  losses
according to their respective shares in the capital.
4/1/2 The objective should not be to hold the investment manager
liable  in  cases  other  than  willful  misconduct,  negligence  or
breach of contract.
4/1/3 The means adopted for capital protection must not be a non-
Shariah  compliant  contract  and  should  not  be  a  pretext  to
achieve an objective violating Shariah.
11031103
Shariah Standard No. (45): Protection of Capital and Investments
4/2 Some permissible methods of protecting capital include:
4/2/1  Takaful  (Islamic  insurance)  for  the  investment  to  protect  the

against a loss of capital without any right of recourse to the
investment manager, such as a government pledge in respect
of  an  investment  project.  In  order  for  this  undertaking  to
be  valid,  the  third  party  should  be  administratively  inde-
pendent of the investment manager and there should be no
direct or indirect ownership relationship of more than a half
between the investment manager and the third party.
4/2/5  An undertaking by a third party to indemnify against a loss
of  capital  resulting  from  the  investment  managers  wilful
misconduct  or  negligence  without  receiving  consideration
for providing such a guarantee. However, the guarantor has
the right of recourse to the investment manager.
4/2/6  Creating  reserves  to  protect  the  capital  through  deductions
from the investors share of profits but not from the investment
managers  share  of  profits  due  to  him  in  his  capacity  as  the
Mudarib.
4/2/7  Diversifying the investment assets to achieve an appropriate
return and minimize risks. This may include:

with financial assets (such as stocks and Sukuk)
with financial assets (such as stocks and
assets denominated in two different currencies.
b) Dividing the capital into two parts by deploying the capital
in Murabahah and Musharakah contracts, respectively.
  The first part is used in Murabahah contracts with parties
that have strong credit ratings in a way that the combination
of  the  principal  amount  and  the  profit  of  Murabahah
protect the initial capital and the second part is invested in
Musharakah contracts.
c) Dividing the capital into two parts by deploying the capital
in Ijarah and Musharakah contracts respectively.
  The first part is used in Ijarah contracts with parties that
have  strong  credit  ratings  in  a  way  that  the  combination
of the principal amount and the rental amount protect the
initial capital and the second part is invested in Musharakah
contracts.
d) Dividing the capital into two parts and deploying them in
Murabahah and Arboun contracts respectively.
  The  first  part  is  used  in  Murabahah  contracts  with  parties
that have strong credit ratings in a way that the combination
of the principal amount and the profit of Murabahah protect
the  initial  capital.  The  second  part  is  used  in  Arboun
contracts to purchase assets. If the value of the assets rises,
the purchase contracts are completed and the assets are sold
for a profit. If the value of the assets declines, the purchase
contracts  are  not  completed  and  the  loss  is  limited  to  the
amount of the Arboun, while the capital is protected by the
Murabahah  contracts.  It  is  compulsory  in  this  method  to
observe the Shariah rules relating to Arboun. This includes
the requirement to reserve the assets sold under the Arboun
contract  from  the  time  of  contract  conclusion  until  the
Arboun
settlement date and the impermissibility of trading in Arboun

from risks, whether those risks are related to the destruction
of  the  original  investment  capital,  depreciation  in  value,
inflation or the fluctuation of exchange rates, etc.
4/2/11  If the investor has required the investment manager to adopt
certain  Shariah-compliant  ways  to  protect  the  capital,  the
manager is obligated to do so. If he does not do so, he is liable
for any resulting loss of capital, in accordance with item 4/4.
5. Shariah Non-Compliant Means for Protecting Capital
It  is  not  permissible  to  protect  the  capital  by  Shariah-non-compliant
means or means that result in violations of the Shariah, such as:
5/1  Stipulating that the investment manager is liable for loss of capital.
5/2  An undertaking by a third party to indemnify for loss of capital in the
cases other than wilful misconduct or negligence of the investment
manager  with  a  right  (of  the  third  party)  to  have  recourse  to  the
investment manager.
5/3  A commitment by or obligating the investment manager to purchase
the investment assets at their nominal price or at a price that was
initially agreed upon.
5/4  An undertaking by a third party to guarantee the capital for a fee.
This is a form of conventional insurance.
5/5  Protecting the capital by use of conventional hedging contracts such
as futures, options and swaps.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
   The basis for capital protection being a desirable objective is the Divine
 The basis for capital protection being a desirable objective is the Divine
Command  to  adopt  ways  and  means  to  protect  wealth  like  having
witnesses  and  documentation  of  the  financial  contracts  and  securing
debt  with  mortgages  and  the  like.  Protection  of  wealth  is  one  of  the
essential objectives that the Shariah has taken care of.
  The  basis  for  the  obligation  of  the  manager  to  take  due  diligence  to
The  basis  for  the  obligation  of  the  manager  to  take  due  diligence  to
protect the investment is that his role regarding the investment is that of
fiduciary. This means that he should manage the investment in a way that
a a fiduciary. This means that he should manage the investment in a way that
serves the interest of the capital provider in his capacity of his fiduciary
representative. He should thus use prudent means consistent with accepted
standard practice to increase the funds.
  The basis for using permissible means to protect the investment is that all
The basis for using permissible means to protect the investment is that all
(financial) contracts are permissible by default unless proved otherwise.
Furthermore, these instruments achieve the intent of the Shariah to safe-
guard wealth.
  The basis for the investment manager not being liable for the loss of the
The basis for the investment manager not being liable for the loss of the
capital,  except  in  cases  of  his  wilful  misconduct  and  negligence  is  the
consensus of Muslim jurists.(2)(2) That is because he takes the capital with the
consensus of Muslim jurists.
 That is because he takes the capital with the
owners permission and deals with it in the interest of the capital provider.
He  is  thus  the  capital  providers  representative  in  terms  of  possessing
and managing the capital. This means that the loss or destruction of the
capital  in  his  possession  is  just  like  its  loss  or  destruction  while  in  the
possession of its owner because he took it with his permission. Moreover,
no person, including the manager is liable to anything without a specific
command by Shariah.

Shariah Standard No. (45): Protection of Capital and Investments
  The basis for the impermissibility to stipulate an absolute guarantee to
The basis for the impermissibility to stipulate an absolute guarantee to
be  provided  by  the  manager,  is  that  this  condition  strips  partnership
(Mudarabah  and  Musharakah)  and  agency  contracts  of  their  essential
content, and turns them into a guaranteed loan contract. Moreover, these
contracts  are  based  upon  trusteeship,  and  this  condition  violates  their
nature and implications; hence, it is void. Ibn Qudamah said, The third
type (i.e., of invalid conditions) is to stipulate what is not in the interest
of the contract nor consistent with its nature and implications; e.g., stipu-
lating that the partner is liable for the capital or for a share of the loss.(3)(3)
lating that the partner is liable for the capital or for a share of the loss.
There is no disagreement among the jurists that this condition is void.(4)(4)
There is no disagreement among the jurists that this condition is void.
   The basis for the opportunity cost not being compensated in the events of
 The basis for the opportunity cost not being compensated in the events of
wilful misconduct or negligence is that it is non-existent wealth which has
not been realised yet. However, realized profit after actual or constructive
liquidation is treated like capital.
Shariah-Compliant Means for Protecting Capital
   The basis for stipulating equality among the partners in bearing loss is
 The basis for stipulating equality among the partners in bearing loss is
that  partnership  is  based  on  equality  between  the  partners.  Stipulating
that some partners should bear the loss more than others should violates
the nature and implications of a partnership contract. Bearing the portion
of loss that is supposed to be borne by another partner causes the latter
partner  to  gain  profit  from  that  for  which  he  has  assumed  no  liability.
The jurists agree that loss sharing in the partnership contract should be
proportional to capital (contribution).(5)(5)
proportional to capital (contribution).
   The basis for the permissibility to protect the capital with Takaful against any
The basis for the permissibility to protect the capital with Takaful against any
type of investment risks is that Takaful is an undertaking to make donations
between  the  participants.  It  is  not  a  contract  to  exchange  counter-values
(Muawadah).  Its  purpose  is  to  achieve  cooperation  and  solidarity  among
the participants. Hence, the Shariah prohibitions that apply to (conventio-
nal) commercial insurance do not apply to it.
  The basis for the permissibility of a third partys undertaking to bear the
The basis for the permissibility of a third partys undertaking to bear the
 the
loss without the right of recourse to the manager is that, according to the

Shariah Standard No. (45): Protection of Capital and Investments
Shariah, this is an undertaking to make a voluntary donation. Therefore, it
is permissible by the Shariah provided that the third party is independent
from the manager so that his undertaking does not result in the manager
becoming the guarantor.
The  basis  for  permissibility  of  deducting  reserve  amounts  (from  the
  The  basis  for  permissibility  of  deducting  reserve  amounts  (from  the
profits)  is  that  it  is  done  with  the  consent  of  the  relevant  parties  and
is  in  the  investors  interest  as  it  strengthens  the  investments  financial
situation.  No  deduction  should  be  made  from  the  managers  share
because the liability for loss is borne by the capital providers, not by the
manager.
The basis for the permissibility of diversifying investment assets is that
  The basis for the permissibility of diversifying investment assets is that
diversification  achieves  the  interest  of  the  investors.  It  does  not  fall
under the prohibition of combining contracts in one contract because
each  contract  is  conducted  independently  of  the  other,  whereby  the
manager  divides  the  capital  into  parts  and  each  part  is  invested
independently in one type of contract or investment asset that differs
from what the other portion of the capital is invested in. This is for the
purpose of mitigating risks and diversifying returns. The parameters
for each of these contracts may be sought by referring to the relevant
Shariah Standard.
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  obtaining  securities  and  guarantees

Breaching  these  conditions  amounts  to  negligence  from  the  manager.

breach.
Shariah Non-Compliant Means for Protecting Capital
  The basis for the prohibition of a third partys undertaking to bear the loss
The basis for the prohibition of a third partys undertaking to bear the loss
with the right of recourse to the manager is that this condition results in
making the manager liable for the loss, which is prohibited by the Shariah.
    The  basis  for  prohibiting  the  manager  from  undertaking  to  buy  the
  The  basis  for  prohibiting  the  manager  from  undertaking  to  buy  the
investment assets at their face value or at a value initially agreed upon is
that this condition results in the manager undertaking to bear the partial
or complete loss of the assets value, which is a forbidden condition as
aforementioned.
  The basis for the prohibition of a third partys guarantee for a fee received
The basis for the prohibition of a third partys guarantee for a fee received
in exchange for the guarantee is that it firstly entails excessive ambiguity
because the extent of the loss is unknown at the inception of the contract,
and because giving a guarantee in exchange for a fee, is prohibited by the
Shariah.

Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers Investment Agency in various fields, or parts thereof,
and the powers and responsibilities of the principal and the investment
agent. It does not cover Agency in general or the acts of Uncommissioned
Agent  (Fodooli)  as  they  are  covered  by  Shariah  Standard  No.  (23)  on
Agency and the Acts of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli).
2. Definition of Investment Agency and Its Permissibility
2/1  Investment Agency means appointing another person to invest and
grow ones wealth, with or without a fee.
2/2 Investment Agency is permissible subject to the relevant Shariah
rules.
3. Investment Agency: Integral Parts (Arkan) and Its Key Types
3/1  The integral parts (Arkan) of a valid investment agency are offer and
acceptance, the subject matter of the contract, and the two contracting
parties (the principal and the agent). [see Shariah Standard No. (23)
for the conditions that are required for a valid agency and the rules
relating to the acts of the uncommissioned agent (Fodooli)]
3/2  It  is  permissible  to  make  the  appointment  of  an  agent  contingent
agency upon the fulfillment of certain conditions or to cause to take
effect  on  a  specified  future  date.  It  is  also  permissible  to  stipulate
conditions/restrictions that are compliant with Shariah. For further
details, see Shariah Standard No. (23).
3/3 It  is  permissible  for  the  investment  agency  to  be  restricted  to
a particular kind of investment, or a specific place or be subject to
other restrictions. It is also permissible that it be unrestricted, in
which case it would still be restricted by customary practice and
that the agent acts in the principals best interests.
11201120
Shariah Standard No (46): Al-Wakalah Bi Al-Istithmar (Investment Agency)
3/4  It is not permissible for any one of the parties to unilaterally amend
the  restrictions  in  the  agency  contract.  [see  Shariah  Standard  No.
(23) for the types of agency]
4. Characteristics of Investment Agency
4/1  Investment agency contracts, whether remunerated or unremuner-
ated,  are  binding  on  institutions  because  they  are  invariably  fixed
term contracts in which both parties agree not to terminate within
a specified period.
4/2  Where the parties agreed to terminate for a specified period, it is
permissible for the contract to stipulate the right of one of the parties
to terminate the contract unilaterally in specific circumstances.
4/3  When the term of an agency expires, the agent is required not to enter
into new investment activities, but may not liquidate ongoing existing
investments.
5. Agency Fee
5/1  If the agency is remunerated, the agents fee should either be a fixed
amount or a percentage of the amount invested. It is also permissible
to  link  the  fee  to  an  established  index/benchmark  that  is  known  to
both  parties  and  is  referred  to  before  every  investment  period  after
the fee of the first period has been determined. It should, however, be
capped and floored (by assigning it maximum and minimum limits).
5/2  If the fee was not specified in the contract and the agent customarily
charges a fee as is normal practice in institutions then the agent will
be entitled to a fee which is prevalent in the relevant markets. This
also applies when the agent does not complete the task required after
starting and realizing returns that are beneficial to the principal.
5/3  The principal is required to pay the investment agents fees in accordance
with stipulated time and manner.
5/4  It is permissible to stipulate that the agent, in addition to his fee, is
entitled to all or part of any amount over and above the expected
profit as a performance incentive.
11211121
Shariah Standard No (46): Al-Wakalah Bi Al-Istithmar (Investment Agency)
6. Amount, Term and Profit of the Investment
6/1 The  amount  and  term  of  the  investment  should  be  determined,
irrespective  of  whether  the  amount  is  paid  as  a  lump  sum  or  in
installments.
6/2  The principal is responsible for any expenses related to the invest-
ment such as transportation, storage, taxes, maintenance and in-
surance. It is not permissible to require the agent to pay them from
the agents own funds, or to defer any reimbursement due to the
agent where he has paid them on behalf of the principal or to make
such reimbursement subject to the yield of the investment. And the
investment agent is liable, as a legal entity, for any expenses related
to its employees or equipment.
6/3  The agent may start investment activity before receiving the funds
(from the principal), and with the principals permission, by:
6/3/1 Incurring a debt on behalf of the principal by purchasing on
credit;
6/3/2 Advancing a loan to the principal by purchasing something on
his behalf.
6/4  Any loan advanced by the agent is construed as an interest free loan
which may not bring any benefit to the agent as creditor. The agent is
entitled to its fee and performance incentive, without consideration
to the loan advanced.
6/5  The profit in its entirety is the right of the principal unless it is stipulated
that the agent shall be entitled to all or part of any excess above the
expected profit as a performance incentive in addition to its fixed fee.
6/6  It is permissible for the agent, with the principals consent, to set aside
a  portion  of  the  profit  to  create  a  profit  equalisation  reserve  for  the
benefit of the principal.
6/7  Upon  liquidation,  the  balance  of  the  profit  equalisation  reserve  is
returned to the principal without affecting the agents entitlement to
the fixed fee or performance incentive for the period in which the
reserve was set aside.
11221122
Shariah Standard No (46): Al-Wakalah Bi Al-Istithmar (Investment Agency)
7. Liability of an Investment Agent
7/1  The  agent  acts  in  a  fiduciary  capacity  in  relation  to  the  investment
and  therefore  is  not  liable  for  any  loss  in  cases  other  than  willful
misconduct,  negligence,  or  breach  of  contract  unless  the  breach
happens to be advantageous to the principal such as selling an asset
for a price higher than the price required by the principal. In situations
where the agent is held liable for loss of capital, such liability is limited
to the capital amount and the agent is not liable for loss of expected
profit whether the capital was invested immediately or delayed or not
invested at all.
7/2  If the investment results in profit or capital gain in case of a breach
that  is  advantageous  to  the  principal,  then  such  profit  or  capital
increase belongs to the principal without affecting the agents right
to its performance incentive.
8. Rights and Obligations of the Contracts Executed by the Agent
  The results of the contract (like transfer of ownership and entitlement to
the fee) belong to the principal. However, the rights and obligations (like
pursuit of payment or delivery including litigation) belong to the agent.
9. Appointment of a Sub-Agent
9/1  The investment agent is not permitted to appoint a sub-agent for the
prescribed investment activities except for activities outside its area
of expertise, or what is normally outside the capacity of the agent or
its employees or where the principal grants the agent permission to
subcontract.
9/2  The sub-agent appointed by the agent with the consent of the principal
cannot be dismissed by the agent but can only be dismissed by the
principal. However, if the principal authorizes the agent to appoint any
sub-agent at his will, the agent is entitled to dismiss the sub-agent.
10. Restrictions Stipulated in Investment Agency
10/1  The investment agent must adhere to a restriction requiring it to
consult the principal before any investment and if any breach by
the agent results in loss, the agent shall bear it.
11231123
Shariah Standard No (46): Al-Wakalah Bi Al-Istithmar (Investment Agency)
10/2 If  the  Investment  Agency  is  restricted  to  activities  that  yield
a minimum specified profit margin and the agent does not find
such an investment, then it should seek the principals consent
before investment. If it invests in lower-yielding transactions, it
is liable to compensate the principal for the difference between
the profit earned and the average profit prevalent in the market
(if it is less than the stipulated amount/percentage). It is not liable
for the minimum profit margin specified for the investment by
the principal. [see Shariah Standard No. (23) on Agency and the
Acts of an Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli), item 6/3/2]
11. Rules of Investment Agency
If  the  agent  co-mingles  his  own  funds  with  the  principals  funds  or
with the funds that he manages, he may not then purchase, for his own
account  any  assets  from  the  assets  owned  by  the  co-mingled  funds
without giving notice on each occasion. This is to establish the transfer
of ownership and liability for the asset from the co-mingled funds to
the  agents  account.  This  requirement  is  impracticable  in  relation  to
investment accounts (and therefore this requirement may be waived).
[see items 7/1/2 and 7/1/3]
See also Shariah Standard No. (23) on Agency and the Acts of an Un-
commissioned Agent (Fodooli).
12. Contemporary Applications of Investment Agency
12/1  Co-mingling the funds of an unrestricted agency with Mudarabah
funds or with the agents funds.
12/1/1  It is permissible to co-mingle funds on the basis of Investment
Agency with funds from Mudarabah investment accounts.
Such funds are treated as if they were extra funds provided by
a capital provider in a Mudarabah investment or
shareholder
a capital provider in a Mudarabah investment or shareholder
funds when they are co-mingled with funds in Mudarabah
investment  accounts.  Allocation  of  profits  is  calculated
by  the  standard  prorated  method  (usually  daily  weighted
11241124
Shariah Standard No (46): Al-Wakalah Bi Al-Istithmar (Investment Agency)
average  method)  for  funds  invested  in  Mudarabah  which
takes  into  account  each  investors  amount  and  the  tenor
of  the  investment.  All  the  profits  of  the  invested  funds
in  Murabahah  belong  to  the  principals  and  the  agent  is
entitled to his fee and any performance incentive stipulated.
The agent is not entitled to any profits generated from the
Mudarabah accounts he invested.
12/2  Investment agency for the financing of working capital(2)(2)
12/2  Investment agency for the financing of working capital
Investment  agency  can  be  used  as  a  substitute  for  an  overdraft.
The amount provided to the client is regarded as the institutions
undivided share in the working capital of the client. It is permissible
for  the  client  to  use  the  withdrawn  amount  to  settle  the  clients
liabilities relating to his activities or his employees salaries. The
client is entitled to a fee for his service and profit from his portion
of the working capital and losses occurring after the agency, if any,
are borne by both parties on a pro-rata basis. If the client has any
interest-bearing deposits or loans, the institution should stipulate
that the client is solely responsible for them.
  When  the  client  does  not  require  financing  anymore,  then  the
relationship  may  be  terminated  on  the  basis  of  Takharuj  which
means that either the joint account is distributed between them
pro-rata or one party will purchase the share of the other at a price
agreed upon at that time.
12/3  Appointing conventional banks by the institutions as their investment
agents and vice versa
12/3/1  It  is  permissible  for  institutions  to  appoint  a  conventional
bank as an investment agent, provided that the relevant con-
tracts  are  compliant  with  Shariah  approved  by  the  institu-
tions Shariah Supervisory Board, and that the conventional
banks have among their activities Shariah-compliant modes
of financing and investment with proper Shariah supervision
 As an alternative to an overdraft, its application requires precise accounting treatment.

and Shariah audit without violating the requirements of the
regulatory authorities.
12/3/2  It is permissible for the institution to accept funds based on
Wakalah from conventional banks and invest them in its ac-
tivities which have been approved by its Shariah Supervisory
Board, provided that the contract is free from conditions and
restrictions that are prohibited by the Shariah.
12/4  Expiry of the investment agency term before collecting amounts
receivable
If  the  agency  expires  and  the  receivables  are  yet  to  be  collected,
and  the  agency  is  not  mutually  renewed,  the  investment  agent  is
required to collect the receivables and take necessary actions against
the debtors or other counter-parties delaying their payments.
  The agent is not entitled to any fee for such collection unless agreed
otherwise. It is not permissible for the agent to use such funds received
for his personal use or to re-invest them. The agent is not required to
pay to the principal such receivables from his own personal funds, or
to seek financing like Tawarruq for this purpose.
12/5 In the event of early termination of the agency either by mutual
agreement,  or  by  one  party  unilaterally  exercising  its  right  to
terminate or by early settlement of the amounts due (from the
obligors), it is permissible (if mutually agreed upon) to reduce
the  performance  incentive  stipulated  for  the  agent,  if  any,  in
proportion to the tenor of the investment.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  The basis for the differentiating between investment agency and agency
The basis for the differentiating between investment agency and agency
in general is that the former is in order to increase wealth, and it is similar
to Mudarabah and Musharakah in this respect. However, the difference
between  investment  agency  and  Mudarabah  and  Musharakah  is  that
Investment  Agency  is  a  form  of  Ijarah  (hiring),  while  Mudarabah  and
Musharakah  are  forms  of  partnership.  As  for  the  general  agency,  it  is
an authorization to perform specific tasks such as payment etc. Even if the
authorization is to engage in a sale/purchase, such as the authorization
of  the  client  in  a  Murabahah  contract,  its  main  purpose  is  to  acquire
ownership for the institution rather than investment on its behalf.
The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  investment  agency  is  the  Hadith
  The  basis  for  the  permissibility  of  investment  agency  is  the  Hadith

be consumed by Zakah(3)(3) as well as numerous Verses of the Qur`an on

 as well as numerous Verses of the Qur`an on
seeking sustenance, striving and earning.
  The  basis  for  the  binding  nature  of  the  investment  agency  is  that  it  is
The  basis  for  the  binding  nature  of  the  investment  agency  is  that  it  is
entered into for a specific period; i.e., there is an agreement between the
counterparties that neither of them can unilaterally dissolve the contract
except in certain circumstances specified in the contract.
  The  basis  for  allocating  for  the  investment  agent  any  profit  amount  in
The  basis  for  allocating  for  the  investment  agent  any  profit  amount  in
excess of the expected profit is that it is a type of conditional gift and is
an incentive.

If the agency contract stipulates a certain percentage of profit and the agent
invests  in  lower-yielding  transactions,  the  agent  is  liable  to  compensate

Shariah Standard No (47): Rules for Calculating Profit in Financial Transactions
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers profit, its validity in Shariah and rules and methods
of calculating and distributing it. It also explains who is entitled to profit
earned from the financing and investment activities of the institutions.
This Standard does not cover profit distribution in investment accounts
because that is provided in a separate Standard.
2. Definition of Profit and Methods of Calculation
In  the  context  of  this  Standard,  Profit  means  the  amount  generated  in
excess of the original capital or of the cost in the operations of financing
and investment activities. Calculation of profit refers to the methods used
to determine the amount of profit in the institutions operations.
3. Permissible and Impermissible Profit
3/1  Permissible profit is that which results from a permissible transaction
such as a sale, lease or partnership, in compliance with Shariah rules
relating to contracts.
3/2  Impermissible profit is that which results from a prohibited transaction
such as interest-based contracts, trade in forbidden commodities and/
or invalid contracts.
4. Determining the Profit Rate in Transactions
4/1  There is no upper limit for profits, provided that the transaction is
based on mutual consent, with due consideration for values of kind-
ness, contentment and clemency.
4/2  In principle, it is impermissible for a regulator to cap profits. However,
in  monopoly  situations,  extraordinary  circumstances  and  cases  of
clear public interest, it is permissible to fix the profit rate, provided it
is not prejudicial.
11381138
Shariah Standard No (47): Rules for Calculating Profit in Financial Transactions
5. Increasing the Profit Rate for Credit Sales over Cash Sales
It is permissible to increase the profit in credit sales as compared to cash
sales, provided that it is incorporated into the price and that the amount
of debt is not increased due to any late payment.
6. Determining Profit in Amounts or Percentages
6/1  The  profit  in  a  Murabahah  contract  may  be  stipulated  as  a  fixed
amount added to the cost price, or as a percentage of the cost price.
6/2  It  is  permissible  to  resort  to  a  well-established  benchmark/index
mutually  agreed  upon  between  the  parties  in  determining  the
profit during the undertaking stage (Wad) or when concluding the
transaction. In all cases, the total price, the dates and amounts of
the installments, if any, must be stipulated and must not vary with
the movement of the benchmark/index. [see Shariah Standard No.
(8) on Murabahah, item 4/6]
7. Setting Different Ratios or Rates for Profit Distribution in Mudarabah
Financing
7/1  In Mudarabah financing it is permissible to set different profit ratios
or rates as per the different tenors of the Mudarabah. The different
rates may also be triggered upon the profit of either party reaching
a specified hurdle rate. In all cases, no party to a Mudarabah contract
may be totally deprived of profit. [see Shariah Standard No. (13) on
Mudarabah, item 8/5]
7/2  It is permissible for the capital provider to stipulate that the mudarib
does not employ the funds in investment activities where the expected
profit rate falls below a specific percentage, taking into consideration
that it is not permissible to either guarantee the capital, or the profit
or both. [see Shariah Standard No. (46) on Investment Agency]
8. Profit Distribution in Shariah-Compliant Deferred Transactions
8/1  It  is  permissible  to  adopt  customary  accounting  practices  that  are
required by supervisory and/or regulatory bodies for calculating and
distributing profit in deferred transactions across several financial
11391139
Shariah Standard No (47): Rules for Calculating Profit in Financial Transactions
periods, provided they are in accordance with Shariah. Whenever
possible,  AAOIFIs  Accounting  Standards  shall  be  adopted  in  this
process.
8/2  When preparing their financial statements, institutions must avoid
any methods of profit calculation or distribution that are misleading
or deceptive.
9.  The  Institution  Must  Disclose  Its  Method  of  Profit  Calculation
and allow its clients to inquire about such methods. Likewise, it must
disclose  such  methods  when  mentioning  profit  in  its  advertising
campaigns and product marketing brochures in order to prevent any
deception. In contracts, Institution must disclose the total price or the
cost  price  and  the  profit,  either  as  a  lump  sum  or  as  a  percentage  of
the cost price. Where profit rate is time-bound, it is impermissible to
re-schedule debt obligations through increasing the profit and/or total
amount by extending the duration.

that  govern  them  and  the  most  important  contemporary  applications  of
each type in the activities of Islamic financial institutions.(1)(1)

11631163
Shariah Standard No. (49): Unilateral and Bilateral Promise
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers promises (unilateral and bilateral) given by certain
parties for the purpose of concluding a contract or effecting a disposal,
and  explains  when  such  instruments  are  binding  and  when  they  are
not, the jurisprudential rules that govern them, and the most important
contemporary  applications  of  each  type  in  the  activities  of  Islamic
financial institutions.
2. Definitions of Unilateral and Bilateral Promises
2/1  For the purpose of this Standard, a unilateral promise is given when
a  party  informs  another  of  its  resolute  intention  (undertaking)  to
act in the future in the interest of the other, with the other having
the option to avail itself of the promise. The party undertaking the
promise is called the promisor, the party receiving the promise is
called the promisee (the beneficiary of the promise) and the action
is called the promised action.
2/2  Bilateral promise in this Standard refers to the exchange of two back-
to-back promises between two parties, each promising to perform
an act in the future relating to the same subject matter.
3. Types of Promises and the Shariah Rules Applicable to Them
3/1  Promising  to  perform  an  act  that  impermissible  by  the  Shariah  is
3/1  Promising  to perform an act  that impermissible  by  the Shariah  is
prohibited, and fulfilling such a promise is also prohibited. Examples
of such promises are those intended to be a ruse to circumvent the
prohibition of interest-bearing (Riba) transactions.
3/2  Any promise in a loan contract that procures benefit for the lender,
over  and  above  the  repayment  of  the  debt,  is  prohibited  by  the
Shariah even if the promise is granted in a document separate from
the loan contract.
11641164
Shariah Standard No. (49): Unilateral and Bilateral Promise
3/3  Any promise in a sale contract made by the buyer or the seller that
results in a repurchase contract (Inah) is prohibited by the Shariah,
whether the promise is part of the sale contract or is given prior or
subsequent to it, such as purchasing an item on credit and promising
to sell it back on spot for a lower price or selling an item on credit
and promising to buy it back on spot for a lower price (reverse Inah).
The same prohibition applies if the parties collude with a third party
to act as an intermediary in the repurchase.
3/4  It is permissible to promise to perform an action or a financial trans-
action and it is then a religious obligation to fulfill it, meaning that
breaking a promise without an excuse is a sin. However, a promise
is not legally binding except when there is a real need for it to be
enforced, such as when the promisor causes the promisee to incur
a liability as a result of the promise. For example, if a person instructs
a merchant to purchase a specific item and then resolutely promises
the merchant that he will buy this item from him. If the merchant
purchases the item solely in reliance on the promise, the promisor
is  legally  bound  to  purchase  the  item  from  him,  failing  which  the
is  legally  bound  to  purchase  the  item from him,  failing which the
promisor  is  required  to  indemnify  the  promisee  (merchant/seller)
for  any  actual  loss  suffered  such  that  if  the  merchant  is  unable  to
sell the item for a price that covers the cost of the item, the promisor
is required to make up the difference between the cost of the item
and the price obtained by the merchant for it. Actual loss does not
include opportunity cost.
3/5  A legally binding promise, as explained in item 3/4 above, is enforceable
only against the promisor and is not enforceable against the promisee
who has the option either to demand performance from the promisor
or to waive it.
3/6  Fulfilling a benevolent promise (such as a promise to make a gift or
lend an item) is a religious obligation but is not binding legally, except
if the promise is conditional upon the promisee performing an action
is legally
that causes the promisee to incur a liability, in which case it is legally
that causes the promisee to incur a liability, in which case it
binding. For example, if the promisor says to the promisee: If you
11651165
Shariah Standard No. (49): Unilateral and Bilateral Promise
buy this item from me, I will give you a gift of another specified item,
fulfilling such a promise is a religious obligation and is legally binding.
3/7  It  is  permissible  for  a  party  to  promise  to  enter  into  a  commutative
contract in the future and for the promisee to promise the first party
to enter into a separate commutative contract with a different subject
matter from that of the first promise. For example, the first party says,
I promise to sell you this item, and the other party says, I promise
to lease to you such and such property, neither of the two promises
is  legally  binding  except  if  a  promisor  causes  a  promisee  to  incur
a liability, in which case such promise is binding. [see item 3/5]
3/8  When a promise is made to enter into a contract in the future, such
contract is not effected automatically. The contract must be entered
into  at  the  relevant  time  by  the  exchange  of  offer  and  acceptance.
Where  the  promise  is  legally  binding,  if  the  offer  is  made  by  the
promisee,  the  promisor  is  bound  religiously  and  legally  to  accept
it. And if the offer is made by the promisor, the promisee has the
option to accept or reject it.
4. Types of Bilateral Promise and the Rules Applicable to Them
4/1  A bilateral promise to perform an act that is prohibited by the Shariah
is itself prohibited such as a bilateral promise to enter into one or more
contracts with the intention to circumvent the prohibition of interest
(Riba);  e.g.,  a  bilateral  promise  to  enter  into  a  sale  and  repurchase
(Inah) contract and a bilateral promise to enter into a sale and a loan.
4/2  Fulfilling a bilateral promise to perform an act that is permitted but not
binding under the Shariah is a religious obligation on both parties but
is not legally binding except in situations where an actual commercial
transaction is not possible without a binding bilateral promise owing
either to legal requirements or to general commercial custom, and the
objective is not merely to provide financing, such as:
4/2/1  Bilateral promises in international trade conducted by means
of documentary credits.
4/2/2  Bilateral promises in supply agreements.
11661166
Shariah Standard No. (49): Unilateral and Bilateral Promise
4/3  The binding bilateral promises referred to in item 4/2 are not future
contracts,  which  means  that  the  promised  contract  is  not  effected
automatically  upon  the  promised  date.  The  contract  must  be
entered into at the relevant time by exchanging notices of offer and
acceptance. Since the bilateral promise is binding on both parties,
if any party makes an offer, the other party is religiously and legally
bound by it. If one party defaults in fulfilling the promise, the other
party  can  obtain  a  court  injunction  requiring  them  to  conclude
the  contract.  If  it  is  not  possible  to  conclude  the  contract  and  the
promisee needs to mitigate his loss by concluding the same contract
with a third party but is not able to recover his cost by means of such
contract, the defaulting party is liable to indemnify him for actual
loss suffered (not to include opportunity cost) if the price obtained
under  the  new  contract  (with  the  third  party)  is  lower  than  price
promised by the defaulting party.
4/4  It is permissible for the two parties to enter into a master agreement
for  future  transactions  where  each  party  has  the  option  whether
or  not  to  enter  into  the  future  transaction.  If  the  parties  enter  into
a  transaction,  then  the  terms  and  conditions  agreed  in  the  general
framework  (master  agreement)  apply.  An  agreement  containing
a a general framework (a master agreement) is a bilateral promise that
general framework (a master agreement) is a bilateral promise that
does not bind any of the parties to enter into those transactions. For
example, an institution and a client wishing to enter into Murabahah
transactions  can  agree  on  a  general  framework  which  explains
the  transaction  process  and  the  terms  and  conditions.  A  general
framework (a master agreement) is not considered to be a concluded
transaction and the client is not required upon signing the framework
to enter into a Murabahah contract. Rather, each party has an option.
When the parties enter into the Murabahah contract by exchanging
notices of offer and acceptance, the contract becomes subject to all the
terms and conditions agreed upon in the general framework (master
agreement)  which  are  expressly  reconfirmed  and  incorporated  in
every contract. [see Shariah Standard No. (37) on Credit Agreement]
11671167
Shariah Standard No. (49): Unilateral and Bilateral Promise
5. Permissible Applications of Promises and Bilateral Promises
5/1  The  promise  given  by  the  client  in  the  Murabahah  transactions
conducted by institutions is legally binding by virtue of item 3/5 of
this Standard. [see Shariah Standard No. (8) on Murabahah]
5/2  The promise given by the institution in Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
transactions to grant the leased asset to the lessee as a gift conditional
on that he pays all the lease installments is legally binding as in item
3/6 of this Standard. [see Shariah Standard (9) on Ijarah Muntahia
Bittamleek]
  The  promise  given  by  the  institution  in  diminishing  Musharakah
transactions that it will lease its share of the asset to the other co-
owner  is  legally  binding  and  the  promise  given  by  the  client  that
he will buy units of the institutions share at stipulated intervals are
legally binding by virtue of item 3/5 of this Standard. [see para 5 of
Shariah Standard No. (12) on Sharikah (Musharakah) and Modern
Corporations]
6. Impermissible Applications
It  is  impermissible  to  enter  into  back-to-back  bilateral  promises  for
the  purpose  of  circumventing  the  prohibition  by  Shariah  of  certain
transactions,  such  as  back-to-back  derivatives  as  in  items  3/1  and  3/7
of  this  Standard.  [see  para  5  of  Shariah  Standard  No.  (20)  on  Sale  of
Commodities in Organized Markets]

The Shariah Basis for the standard
The International Islamic Fiqh Academy resolved: In situations where
a  sale  contract  cannot  be  concluded  because  the  seller  does  not  own  the
commodity and there is a public interest in obligating both parties to sign
a contract in the future by virtue of law or otherwise, or according to inter-
national norms and customs, as in the case of opening letters of credit for
importing goods, bilateral promise can be made binding to the two parties.

Shariah Standard No. (50): Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers the Shariah rules and requirements for Irrigation
Partnership  (Musaqat)  and  its  applications  in  the  activities  of  Islamic
financial institutions. It does not cover other forms of agricultural part-
nership as they have separate Shariah standards dedicated to them.
2. Definition of Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
  A contract between the owner of an orchard or its usufruct and a worker
(irrigator)  agreeing  to  share  the  produce  according  to  specific  ratios
stipulated at the time of contract.
3. Permissibility and Description of the Contract
Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat) is a permissible contract that becomes
binding on commencement of the work or if mutually agreed between
the two parties not to terminate the contract before its expiry.
4. Elements of Irrigation Partnership
4/1  Offer and acceptance should be exchanged explicitly or implicitly by
means of a recognised form of indication.
4/2  Each of the two parties should be legally competent.
4/3  The relevant trees should be identified, arable (productive), and in
need of irrigation and plant husbandry.
5. Conditions of Validity (Prerequisites)
5/1  The contract should stipulate for each party a predetermined, defined,
indivisible share of the produce.
5/2  The work should be restricted to the husbandry of the crop and trees.
The owner may not (in this contract) demand any additional work
from the worker (irrigator).
11801180
Shariah Standard No. (50): Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
5/3  The contract is valid until the time of harvest or for a defined period
in which the crop is normally enough for harvest.
6. Duties of the Worker (Irrigator)
6/1  The worker (irrigator) is obligated to care for the trees and crops
as per agreement with the owner and customary requirements, in-
cluding:
6/1/1 Carrying out plant husbandry by watering, pollinating, fertil-
ising, weeding, maintaining and cleaning irrigation channels,
pruning, controlling pests, harvesting and performing season-
al work that is usually required for each type of tree.
6/1/2 Not commissioning or subcontracting a third party to carry
out his work without the permission of the owner. If he does
so,  the  owner  of  the  trees  has  the  option  to  ratify  the  third
party contract or reject it.
6/2  The worker (irrigator) may employ others to assist him to carry out
part or all of the contracted work.
6/3  The worker (irrigator) acts in a fiduciary capacity and is not liable
for any loss arising from other than wilful misconduct, negligence
or  breach  of  the  terms  of  the  contract.  In  such  a  case,  he  is  liable
to indemnify the owner against any actual loss caused, but remains
entitled to his share of the crop.
7. Duties of the Owner of the Trees
  The owner should facilitate for the worker (irrigator) full access to the trees
(subject of contract), and remove any impediments which may hinder the
work of the worker (irrigator).
8. Joint Duties of the Worker (Irrigator) and the Owner of Trees
8/1  After harvesting, the worker (irrigator) and the owner are obligated
to  take  care  of  the  crop,  each  in  proportion  to  his  share.  Prior  to
harvesting, the worker (irrigator) is obligated to take care of the crop
unless custom or a term of the contract dictates otherwise.
11811181
Shariah Standard No. (50): Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
8/2  The worker (irrigator) and the owner are responsible for the expenses
of the Irrigation Partnership in proportion to their shares, including
any Takaful insurance, unless they agree otherwise.
8/3  The worker (irrigator) is solely responsible for performing the work
customarily undertaken by workers (irrigators) in similar Irrigation
Partnerships  and  such  work  does  not  entitle  him  to  any  increase
in  his  share  of  the  crop  as  he  is  already  contractually  obligated  to
carry it out. If he hires others to perform his work, their wage is his
sole  responsibility  and  should  not  be  taken  from  the  overall  crop.
The  worker  (irrigator)  may  hire,  on  the  account  of  the  Irrigation
Partnership, others to perform work that is customarily beyond the
scope of his duties.
8/4  If the worker (irrigator) refuses to complete the term of the Irri-
gation  Partnership  after  commencing  work  or  entering  into  the
contract, the owner should demand performance from him. If the
worker  (irrigator)  stops  working  before  the  crop  materializes  he
is not entitled to any share. If he stops working after the crop ma-
terializes but before it is ready for harvest, a third party should be
hired to complete the work and his wage should be deducted from
the workers (irrigators) share after the crop is harvested and sold.
If the workers (irrigators) share is not sufficient to pay the third
partys wage, the worker (irrigator) must make up the difference.
If the workers (irrigators) share of the crop is more than the third
partys wage, he keeps the difference.
8/5  In an Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat) that is due to terminate when
the crop materializes or is ready for harvest, if the owner does not
enable the worker, and this occurs before the crop materializes, then
the owner shall be requested to enable the worker (irrigator) to com-
plete his work. If the owner does not enable the worker (irrigator),
then the worker (irrigator) shall be entitled to a wage at the market
rate for similar work. If this occurs after the crop materializes, the
worker (irrigator) is entitled to his stipulated share of the crop.
11821182
Shariah Standard No. (50): Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
9. Division of Produce
9/1  In principle, all recurring produce of the trees should be shared as
part of the crop, such as fruits, palm leaves etc. unless the parties
agree to restrict their sharing arrangement to just the fruits.
 9/2 The worker (irrigator) is entitled to his share of the crop on an indi-
visible basis as soon as it materializes.
10. Contingencies in Irrigation Partnerships
10/1 If the crop does not materialize
10/1 If the crop does not
 at all or is completely destroyed by
materialize at all or is completely destroyed by
a natural disaster, the worker (irrigator) is not entitled to anything.
If the natural disaster destroys only part of the crop, the parties
divide what remains according to their stipulated shares.
10/2  If the crop does not materialize during the stipulated term, the worker
(irrigator) has the option either to stop working or to continue his
work without a wage until the crop materializes and thereafter takes
his  share.  If  he  stops  working  without  a  valid  excuse,  he  foregoes
his right to a share of the crop when it materializes. If he has a valid
excuse, he is entitled to the portion of his share that corresponds to
the period of time worked in proportion to the total time the crop
took to materialize.
11. Trees Belonging to Third Parties and Usurped Trees
11/1  If it transpires that the trees belong to a third party, the crop will
then  belong  to  him  (the  third  party).  In  this  case,  the  worker
(irrigator) is entitled to a wage or compensation from the other
party (the usurping party) at the market rate for similar work but
not exceeding (what would have been) his share of the crop.
11/2 If  the  worker  (irrigator)  enters  into  an  Irrigation  Partnership
(Musaqat) with a party who, unbeknown to the worker (irriga-
tor), has usurped the trees, then the produce, if any, will belong
to the owner of the trees and the worker (irrigator) will be en
titled
to the owner of the trees and the worker (irrigator) will be entitled
to a wage at fair market rate. But if the worker (irrigator) knew
that the trees were usurped, then he is not entitled to any remu-
neration.
11831183
Shariah Standard No. (50): Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
12. Termination of Irrigation Partnership Contract (Musaqat)
  The  Irrigation  Partnership  (Musaqat)  contract  terminates  upon  the
occurrence of any of the following:
12/1  Harvest and division of the crop, if the Irrigation Partnership was
linked to the produce of a specific season.
12/2  Completion of the agreed term and division of the crop in accordance
with Item 10/2.
12/3  Death  of  the  worker  (irrigator)  or  liquidation  of  the  institution
carrying  out  the  work  if  the  Irrigation  Partnership  (Musaqat)
contract  stipulates  that  the  work  is  non-assignable.  If  there  is  no
such stipulation, the successor has the option to complete the work
on the same terms, either himself or by hiring workers (irrigators),
in  return  for  the  deceaseds  (or  liquidated  institutions)  share  of
the  crop.  If  the  successor  chooses  not  to  complete  the  work,  the
owner may complete the work himself or by hiring others and upon
 of the crop, the successor of the worker (irrigator) is
materialization of the crop, the successor of the worker (irrigator) is
materialization
entitled to receive a wage at the market rate for similar work for the
period of time worked by the deceased (or liquidated institution)
but not exceeding his (or its) stipulated share of the crop.
12/4  Death of the trees that are the subject matter of the contract or
inability of the trees to bear fruit.
12/5  Passing of a season without any fruit.
13. Revocation of Irrigation Partnership Contract (Musaqat)
13/1  Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat) contract is revocable by mutual
consent of the two parties (Iqalah).
13/2  The owner can revoke the contract in the following situations:
13/2/1 When the worker (irrigator) is unable to perform the work,
in which case the following apply:
13/2/1/1 If the worker (irrigator) is unable to work for a reason outside
his control, such as an illness, he is entitled to receive a wage
11841184
Shariah Standard No. (50): Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
at  the  market  rate  for  similar  work  for  the  period  of  time
worked.
13/2/1/2 If the worker (irrigator) is unable to work for a reason within
his control, he is entitled to receive a wage at the market rate
for similar work for the period of time worked. He is also liable
to indemnify the owner for actual loss suffered, as determined
by experts.
13/2/2 When  the  worker  (irrigator)  stops  working  and  it  is  not
possible to enforce him (to fulfil the terms of the contract).
13/3  The worker (irrigator) is entitled to revoke the contract if the owner
refuses to allow him to work. [see item 8/5]
14. Zakat Due on Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat)
See Shariah Standard No. (35) on Zakat, item 5/4/9.
15. Some Applications of Irrigation Partnership (Musaqat) in Financial
Institutions

contracts with the owners of trees and then hire workers (irriga-
tors) to carry out the work.

common  sense.  From  the  Sunnah,  there  is  the  Hadith  narrated  by  Ibn
Umar that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) gave the land of
Khaybar to its inhabitants to work on and cultivate in return for half of
its yield (fruits and plants).(2)(2)
its yield (fruits and plants).
  Based  on  Ijma,  the  companions  (may  Allah  be  pleased  with  them)
practiced Musaqat in Khaybar until Umar (may Allah be pleased with
him) evacuated them therefrom, without any objection from whosoever.
Ijma  or  consensus  (by  Four  Schools  of  Fiqh)  as  to  permissibility  of
Musaqat was cited by prominent scholars Al-Bisyawi, Ibn Hazm and Al-
Utabi, Muwaffaq Al-Din Ibn Qudamah, Shams Al-Din Ibn Qudamah

  On the basis of common sense, Musaqat fulfils the interest of both par-
ties, and is associated with no harm.

The basis for the necessity for identification of trees (subject matter of

The basis for the stipulation of irrigation and cultivation of trees is that
work is one of the requisite elements of the contract (Arkan), and Musa-
qat is invalid in the absence of one of its requisite elements.
Prerequisites of Validity
  The  basis  for  specification  of  a  predetermined,  common  share  for  both
The  basis  for  specification  of  a  predetermined,  common  share  for  both
parties to the contract is the Hadith narrated by Ibn Omar that the Prophet
(peace be upon him) gave the land of Khaybar to its inhabitants to work
on  and  cultivate  in  return  for  half  of  its  yield  (fruits  and  plants).  The
specification of lump-sum compensation will divert the contract away from
the features of Musaqat. The determination of a known compensation is
meant to avert impermissible obscurity (Jahalah).
The basis for the confinement of work to fruit growing and tree cultiva-
  The basis for the confinement of work to fruit growing and tree cultiva-
tion is that this what entails work in Musaqat; if another form of work
is stipulated in the contract, such a stipulation shall contradict the very
nature of the contract, as it only fulfils the interests of one party at the
expense of the other.
  The  basis  for  making  the  term  of  Musaqat  equal  to  the  period  ending
The  basis  for  making  the  term  of  Musaqat  equal  to  the  period  ending
with  the  time  the  produce  materializes  or  over  a  term  enough  for  the
produce to materialize is the rules of justice in Shariah so that the trees
owner does not exclusively benefit from the produce while the worker
receives nothing. The produce is what the contract is meant to achieve
after all, and therefore it is impermissible that the worker is devoid of his/
her rights by shortening the term of Musaqat.

Obligations of the Worker (Irrigator)
The basis for the workers obligation to undertake normal care of the trees
  The basis for the workers obligation to undertake normal care of the trees
and for the produce of fruits is that the people of Khaybar were entrusted
with the work, without anyone else being sent by the Prophet (peace be
upon him) to take up some of Musaqat works.
The basis for the prohibition of sub-contracting in Musaqat without prior
   The basis for the prohibition of sub-contracting in Musaqat without prior
permission is that the trees are not the property of the worker (irrigator), nor
the worker is authorized by the owner of trees to do so. And notwithstanding,
the owner may not accept that the worker (irrigator) assigns the Musaqat
contract to a third-party irrigator.
   The basis for the permissibility of using the services of hired hands or
 The basis for the permissibility of using the services of hired hands or
the  like  by  the  worker  (irrigator)  is  the  general  condition  cited  by  the
Prophet (peace be upon him) to the people of Khaybar that they may
seek the services of hired hands, but only at their own expense. However,
the workers responsibility/liability shall not cease to exist.(6)(6)
the workers responsibility/liability shall not cease to exist.

The basis for the Musaqat worker acting in a fiduciary capacity (rather
than  a  position  of  liability)  is  that  he/she  is  an  agent  on  behalf  of  the
owner in preservation and care of trees and fruits.
Obligations of Trees Owner

The basis for the necessity to enable unfettered disposal of the trees for
the worker is to allow the worker to perform his duties as per the contract.
Joint Obligations of the Worker and the Owner of Trees
  The basis for the joint responsibility of the owner of trees and the worker
The basis for the joint responsibility of the owner of trees and the worker
for the preservation of fruits before harvesting is that the owner may take
the fruits after harvesting, However, before harvesting, the worker alone
shall be responsible for the trees and fruits because the owner has granted
him unfettered access to the trees.
  The basis for the division of expenses between the owner and the worker
The basis for the division of expenses between the owner and the worker
(from their respective shares) is that it is more just (closer to justice) so
that no harm is inflicted upon either party because of the other.

neither party shall have the right to revoke it unilaterally. And the basis for
the non-entitlement of the worker to any compensation in case he stopped
the  work  before  materialization  of  the  produce  is  that  he  abandoned

the expense of the worker because in such a case the worker (Al-Musaqi)

complete the work, and such an obligation shall not be considered fulfilled
unless  work  is  completely  carried  out.  Otherwise,  the  wage  of  the  hired
hands shall be deducted from the share of the worker (Al-Musaqi).
The basis for obligating the owner of trees, in case he prevented the worker
  The basis for obligating the owner of trees, in case he prevented the worker
from carrying out the work of Musaqat, to completely fulfil the contract is
that the Musaqat contract becomes binding upon commencement of work
or upon commitment of non-revocation (of the contract). And in the event
that the owner revokes the contract before the produce materializes, the
basis for obligating the owner to pay out the prevailing market wages is that
the time and effort of the worker shall have to be compensated. And in the
event that the owner revokes the contract after the produce materializes,
then the worker is only entitled to his share in the produce (but not the
prevailing market wages).
Division of the Produce
  The basis for the inclusivity of division of recurring produce is that the
The basis for the inclusivity of division of recurring produce is that the
worker contributes with his work to the produce and thus shall not be
deprived of his respective share. This roughly conforms to the standpoint
of Ibadis and Malkis jurists, and coincides with the opinion of some of
Hanifis. It has reported that Abu Said Al-Khudri opined that the worker
deserves a share in the palm racemes and cotton straws, unless there is
a customary practice (Urf) or a condition (Shart) to the contrary. Abu
Amr Al-Qurtubi also said: Torn palm leaves and fibers and cords shall be
shared by both parties according to their respective shares in the fruits,
and this conforms to the law of equity. (7)(7)

the times of the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to pay rental for plants
growing  on  water  ravines/flumes/gullies  and  high  points  of  streams  and
some sorts of plants. However, the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited

one of the effects of partnership entails that the subject-matter of division

shall be no division. The same applies to the division of remaining produce
in case of partial destruction due to a natural disaster.

remain in the hands of the owner unless by virtue of a contract. However,
the contract, in this case, is void. The basis for obligating the party who
contracted with the worker to pay out the prevailing wage to the maximum
of his stated share is that he worked on a commutative basis, and the contract
was  doubtful  (not  properly  evidenced  or  documented);  it  is  impractical
to  pay  him  the  agreed  compensation  due  to  the  ownership  of  the  third
party, who shall be entitled to the compensation; i.e., the prevailing wage,
up to a maximum of his stated share because the contracting party did not
commit to pay him more than his share, especially that no transgression
was premeditated.

The basis for entitlement of the owner of trees to take the fruits in case
an  usurper  (Ghasib)  of  the  trees  contracted  with  someone  else  to  carry
out  Musaqat  works  is  that  the  fruits  remain,  in  essence,  owned  by  the
owner unless by a contract to the contrary. And the contract here is void.
The basis for obligating the usurper (Ghasib) to pay the worker who was
unaware  of  usurpation  is  that  it  is  tantamount  to  a  paid  work  (work  on
a commutative basis) associated with a doubtful contract; it is impossible to
pay him the agreed compensation because it belongs to someone else, who
shall be entitled to the compensation; i.e., the prevailing wage. The worker
shall be deprived of any payment if he is aware of usurpation because in
such a case he becomes a transgressor, and he is among those referred to in

the option either to carry on the work as per the set conditions or to stop it
is that the heirs or the owners of the institution have had legally inherited
this right. The basis for their entitlement to the prevailing wage is that their
testator was entitled to the compensation by virtue of his efforts. So if he had
died before the produce materialized, then he shall be entitled to the com-
pensation. The basis for limiting the compensation, which is the prevailing
wage, to a maximum of the testators share in the produce is that the owner
of trees did not commit to pay more than the workers share. And if conti-
nuation of work by the heirs does not entitle them to more than the share

The basis for obligation to pay the prevailing wage if the worker is unable to
perform the work due to a reason out of his control is that the worker did

entirety, and thus he is paid the prevailing market wage.

Shariah Standard No. (51): Options to Revoke Contracts Due to Incomplete Performance
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers options to revoke contracts due to reasons of defect,
deal fragmentation and breach of description. It does not cover options
to revoke arising from breach of trust (dishonest inducement, deception
and overcharging) or options of due diligence (cooling-off options, and
options to revoke due to non-payment) as they have separate Shariah
standards dedicated to them.
2. Option to Revoke Due to Defect
2/1  Definition
It is the option of a buyer to revoke or continue with the contract
arising  from  a  hidden  defect  that  the  buyer  did  not  notice  at  the
time of contract.
2/2  Conditions applicable to options to revoke due to defect
  An option to revoke due to defect is subject to the following conditions:
2/2/1 Appearance of a material defect in the subject matter of the
contract.
A material defect is a defect that renders the item defective
according to custom, makes it unfit for purpose or diminishes
its value.
2/2/2 The defective item being incapable of repair except by incurring
cost.
2/2/3 The buyer being unaware of the hidden defect at the time of
contract, irrespective of the sellers awareness of the defect at
the time of the contract.
2/2/4 The contract not containing a clause excluding the sellers li-
- sale on the basis of as is
Bay al-Bara`ah- sale on the basis of as is
ability for defect (Bay al-Bara`ah
ability for defect (

Shariah Standard No. (51): Options to Revoke Contracts Due to Incomplete Performance
where is). It is prohibited for the seller to exclude liability due
to defect in Ijarah and Istisnaa contracts.
2/2/5 The hidden defect not being caused by the buyer.
2/3  Scope of the option to revoke due to defect
  Options to revoke due to defect exist in commutative financial con-
tracts such as sales, money exchange, division of wealth, settlement
of  debt  by  payment  in  kind  and  gift  conditional  upon  receipt  of
consideration (Hibat al-Thawab
consideration (
Hibat al-Thawab).).
2/4  Time limit
  Defective  items  should  be  returned,  after  taking  delivery  of  the
object of sale and discovering the defect therein, within the period
of time customarily allowed for revocation on such grounds.
2/5 Consequences of options to revoke due to defect
 2/5 Consequences of options to revoke due to defect
  The buyer has the option either to revoke the contract and return the
item or continue with the contract. If the buyer chooses to return the
item after taking delivery, revocation is effected by mutual consent
or court order. If the buyer has not taken delivery, and he has been
aware of the defect before taking delivery, he can unilaterally revoke
the  contract  by  giving  notice  to  the  seller  and  is  entitled  upon
revocation to a refund of the whole price by mutual consent or court
order.
2/6  Conditions applicable to the return of sold items
  Return of the item is subject to the following conditions:
2/6/1 Return  of  the  item  not  resulting  in  the  fragmentation  of
a package deal to which the seller does not consent. And the
buyer  shall  be  entitled  to  compensation  against  inferiority
due to the defect (Arsh).
2/6/2 The item not being damaged or destroyed in the possession
of  the  buyer,  in  which  case  the  buyer  is  entitled  only  to
compensation for the defect and is not entitled to return the
item unless the seller accepts return of the damaged item.
12031203

2/6/3 There being nothing added to the item attached to it but did
not  grow  out  of  it,  which  necessities  a  price  rebate,  such  as
the erection of a building on land. Return of the item is not
prevented, if the addition to the item is physically connected to
it and grows out of it; or is physically separate from it whether
it grows out of it, such as dividends on shares and rent from
leased assets, or does not grow out of it.
2/6/4 In cases where return due to the defect is impossible (impracti-
cal), the buyer shall be entitled to compensation against inferi-
ority caused by the defect.
2/7  Impediments preventing the return of sold items
  The option to return the sold item is impeded by the non-fulfilment
of any of the conditions provided in item 2/2.
2/8  Abating (of the option)
  The option to revoke due to defect ceases (abates) in the following
situations:
2/8/1 If the defect ceases before the buyer returns the item or payment
of Arsh (compensation against inferiority due to the defect).
2/8/2 If the buyer expressly waives his option to revoke.
2/8/3 If the buyer expressly accepts the defective item.
2/8/4  If the buyers conduct implicitly indicates that he has accepted the
defective item, such as continuing to use the item, delaying return
of the defective item longer than is customarily acceptable and
without an excuse, exploiting or benefitting from the defective
item or transferring ownership of the item after discovering the
defect.
2/8/5 If the defective item is destroyed by the buyer.
3. Option to Revoke Owing to Deal Fragmentation
3/1  Definition
  The option to revoke a contract owing to deal fragmentation is the
option  of  the  buyer  to  revoke  a  contract  (a  package  deal)  that  no

Shariah Standard No. (51): Options to Revoke Contracts Due to Incomplete Performance
longer includes everything that was contracted for, resulting in the
package deal becoming fragmented.
3/2  Conditions applicable to the option to revoke owing to deal frag-
mentation
  The option to revoke a contract owing to deal fragmentation is subject
The option to revoke a contract owing to deal fragmentation is subject
to the buyer not knowing that the deal would become fragmented.
3/3  Types of deal fragmentation in which the option to revoke is granted
3/3/1 When a person sells his own property along with the property
of another person in one package without the consent of the
other person or when a partner sells the partnership property
in one package without the consent of the other partner.
3/3/2 When it transpires that part of the sold item(s) is the property
of a third party.
3/3/3 When  part  of  the  sold  item(s)  is  destroyed  before  delivery
(actual or constructive).
3/3/4 When  part  of  the  sold  item(s)  in  a  Salam  contract  is  not
available on the delivery date. [see Shariah Standard No. (10)
on Salam, item 5/8]

Hadith narrated by A`ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that a man
purchased a young serf, and then set him to work, then he found him
to be flawed or defective, so he returned him back (to the seller) on
the grounds of the defect. Thereupon, the Prophet (peace be upon him)

that the buyer has the right to return the subject-matter due to defect and
the absence of intactness as generally dictated by the contract. The basis
for non-entitlement to compensation (Arsh) in the case where the buyer
keeps the subject-matter is that descriptions (features) are not considered
to form part of the price in this case, and because the buyer did not consent
that the sold item was transferred for a less than its stated price. The Han-

Shariah Standard No. (52): Options to Reconsider (Cooling-Off Options, Either-Or
Options, and Options to Revoke Due to Non-Payment)
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers options to reconsider (cooling-off options, either-
or options, and options to revoke due to non-payment) that are stipulated
by the parties to grant them time to reconsider the transaction. It does
not  cover  options  to  revoke  contracts  due  to  incomplete  performance
(defect, deal fragmentation and breach of condition or description) or
options to revoke contracts due to breach of trust (dishonest inducement,
deception  and  overcharging)  as  they  have  separate  Shariah  Standards
dedicated to them.
2. Cooling-Off Options
2/1  Definition of cooling-off options
  Cooling-off options give one or both of the parties or a third party
the right either to continue with the contract or to revoke it within
a stipulated period of time. It is effected by any phrase indicating that
it is non-binding and revocable during the period of the option.
2/2  Conditions of validity
  Cooling-off options are subject to the following conditions:
2/2/1 The option must be stipulated in the contract unless it is implied
by  a  pre-existing  custom  or  the  parties  agree  to  subsequently
include it in the contract.
2/2/2 The option must have a stipulated time limit. The option is not
valid if a time limit is not stipulated or if it is unspecified, such
as a stipulation to refer to an expert without stating a time limit,
or if the time limit is indeterminate, such as stipulating that
the option will end when a certain index reaches a particular
value. There is no minimum or maximum time limit except if
12181218
Shariah Standard No. (52): Options to Reconsider (Cooling-Off Options, Either-Or
Options, and Options to Revoke Due to Non-Payment)
it is contrary to what is customarily acceptable in relation to
the subject matter of the contract.
2/2/3 The stipulated cooling-off period must coincide with the be-
ginning of the contract period.
2/2/4  If the contract relates to several items, it must specify those items
to which the option relates, as provided in item 2/8/3.
2/2/5 The subject matter must remain in the condition it was initially
in when it was sold, in accordance with item 2/6.
2/3  Scope
  Cooling-off  options  apply  to  binding  financial  contracts,  such  as
sale, lease, transfer of debt, guarantee, division of wealth and Waqf.
They do not apply to non-binding contracts such as unpaid agency
or  contracts  which  require  payment  in  advance,  such  as  Salam  or
which require spot payment of both countervalues such as currency
exchange.
2/4  Consequences of cooling-off options
2/4/1 The owner of the option has the right to confirm the contract
or revoke it during the stipulated period. If he does not revoke
it during this period, the option lapses and the contract become
binding.
2/4/2 The owner of the option may test the sold item and does not
thereby lose his right to revoke the contract except if he does
so repetitively without need or conducts himself as the owner
of the sold item in a manner that is contrary to the terms of the
contract and/or custom.
2/4/3 Where there is a cooling-off option, the parties are not required
to make payment or delivery (the sold item to the buyer and
the  price  to  the  seller)  unless  they  agree  otherwise.  One  or
both  parties  may  voluntarily  make  payment  or  delivery  and
the option does not lapse as a result, except if the conduct of
the parties towards the countervalues indicates the intention
to  give  or  take  ownership.  If  one  party  makes  payment  or
12191219
Shariah Standard No. (52): Options to Reconsider (Cooling-Off Options, Either-Or
Options, and Options to Revoke Due to Non-Payment)
delivery, the other is entitled to hold back, in which case the
first party is entitled to demand return of what they have paid/
delivered.
2/4/4 The owner of the option may offer the item to which the option
relates for sale to third parties, and the option does not lapse
until the sale is completed.
2/5  Effect of options to cool-off on ownership
2/5/1 If the option to cool-off is owned by both parties or just the
seller, there is no transfer of ownership in either countervalue
and legal rights related to the subject matter remain solely with
the seller to the exclusion of the buyer.
2/5/2 If the option is owned by just the buyer, ownership of the sold
item  transfers  from  the  seller  to  the  buyer  and  the  buyers
conduct as the owner of the sold item serves as confirmation
of the contract.
2/5/3 If an item sold under option is destroyed while in the possession
of the seller, it is the sellers loss. If it is destroyed in the possession
of the buyer while the buyer owns the option, he is liable to pay
its price. If it is destroyed in the possession of the buyer owing
to his negligence or violation while the seller owns the option
and decides to revoke the contract, the buyer is liable to pay its
cost.  If  it  is  destroyed  in  the  possession  of  the  buyer  without
there being any negligence or violation on his part, he has no
liability.
2/6  Rules relating to increase in the sold item during the option period
2/6/1 Anything  that  is  physically  connected  and  grows  out  of  the
original, such as agricultural produce (crops) or animal pro-
duce (livestock) belongs to the buyer if the buyer owns the op-
tion and confirms the contract. And it belongs to the seller of
the seller owns the option, whether he confirms the contract
or revokes it.
12201220
Shariah Standard No. (52): Options to Reconsider (Cooling-Off Options, Either-Or
Options, and Options to Revoke Due to Non-Payment)
2/6/2 Anything that is physically separate and does not grow out of
the original, such as compensation for damage to the sold item
caused by a third party during the option period, belongs to
the buyer if he chooses to conclude the contract. If he chooses
to revoke the contract, it belongs to the seller.
2/6/3 Anything that is separate but grows out of the original, such as
dividends on shares and rent from leased assets belongs to the
seller.
2/7  Cessation and lapsing of cooling-off options
2/7/1  When the option period expires, the contract becomes binding.
2/7/2 When the owner of the option exercises his option to revoke
the  contract,  then  the  contract  terminates.  It  is  required  for
the other party to know of the revocation for the revocation
to be valid. If the owner of the option concludes the contract,
whether expressly or implicitly, the contract becomes binding.
2/7/3 If the sold item is destroyed before physical or constructive
delivery, the contract terminates.
2/8  Some applications of cooling-off options
2/8/1 The institution, whether as a seller or buyer, stipulates an op-
tion to reconsider whether or not it is worth selling or buying
an item.
2/8/2 The institution stipulates an option to reconsider when pur-
chasing items from suppliers in order to offer them to its clients
without obtaining a binding promise from them to purchase
the items. If the clients do not wish to purchase the items, the
institution returns the items to the seller.
2/8/3 The institution stipulates an option to reconsider in relation
to  the  whole  or  a  part  of  a  single  deal.  If  the  various  items
being sold are different from each other, the items to which the
option relates must be specified. If they are fungible, such as
wheat or rice, the percentage to which the option relates must
be specified.
12211221
Shariah Standard No. (52): Options to Reconsider (Cooling-Off Options, Either-Or
Options, and Options to Revoke Due to Non-Payment)
2/8/4 It is not permissible to use cooling-off options as a ruse to syn-
thesise the effect of a benefit enjoyed by the lender in exchange
for a giving a loan, which can occur if the buyer pays for an item
purchased under option, uses the item during the option period
and then returns it before the option period expires to receive
his money back.
2/8/5 It is not permissible to use cooling-off options to avoid price
fluctuations during the option period.
3. Option to Revoke Due to Non-Payment
3/1  Definition of option to revoke for non-payment
  Options to revoke due to non-payment are options stipulated by sellers
or buyers to enable them to revoke contracts if the other party fails to
make payment of price or rent on the due date. Such options are not
valid unless they are expressly stipulated.
3/2  Scope of option to revoke for non-payment
  Options to revoke for non-payment are permissible in contracts that do
not require spot payment at time of contract. They are not permissible
in Salam and currency exchange contracts.
3/3  Prerequisites
  The seller is entitled to revoke the contract if the buyer does not pay
the price within the specified period.
3/4  Transfer
  Options to revoke due to non-payment lapse upon the death of the
owner of the option (whether it is the seller or the buyer).
4. Either-Or Options
4/1  Definition
4/1/1 Either-or options entitle the buyer to conclude the contract to
purchase one or more item out of several items specified by
the contract during a stipulated period of time. Such options
are created by stipulation of the parties.
12221222
Shariah Standard No. (52): Options to Reconsider (Cooling-Off Options, Either-Or
Options, and Options to Revoke Due to Non-Payment)
4/1/2 It is not required for the items being sold to be fungible or for
their prices to be equal. If their prices are different, the price of
each item must be specified.
4/1/3 The agreed option period must be specified and there is no
minimum or maximum time limit.
4/2  Prerequisites
4/2/1 Either-or options make ownership attached to one or more of
several items to which the option relates but not to any item or
items in particular. If the buyer takes delivery of all of them, he
is liable to pay for one of them and holds the remaining items on
trust. If one of them is destroyed or damaged in his possession,
he must purchase it for its price. If all items are destroyed and
their prices are different, the buyer is liable to pay the average
price  of  the  items  for  the  number  of  items  purchased.  For
example, if there are three items and he purchased one of them
with an option to choose which one, he is liable to pay one third
of the price of each item.
4/2/2 If the items to which the either-or option relates are destroyed
by an act of the seller after the buyer has taken delivery, the
buyer is not liable.
4/2/3 If the option period expires without the buyer choosing which
item or items he wishes to confirm, he is legally obligated to do
so unless the seller chooses to revoke the contract.
4/2/4 If the buyer treats one of the items in which he has an option as
though he owns them, his conduct is deemed to be confirmation
of the contract for those items.
4/3  Transfer
  Either-or  options  transfer  to  the  heirs  of  the  owner  of  the  option
upon his death who in which case enjoy all the rights of the original
owner of the option.

Options, and Options to Revoke Due to Non-Payment)
  The basis for permissibility (but not the obligability) of delivery of the two
The basis for permissibility (but not the obligability) of delivery of the two
countervalues is that delivery serves both selection and reconsideration,
which are literally the purpose of the option.
  The basis for the situation where the option does not abate upon offering
The basis for the situation where the option does not abate upon offering
it  for  sale  is  that  such  a  practice  is  meant  to  probe  the  fairness  of  the
price. However, it does abate in case of actual sale because this serves as
a  testimony  to  acceptance,  as  the  disposal  of  the  object  underlying  the
option is considered to be as the disposal by owners.
The basis for effecting ownership upon sale is that the price does not
  The basis for effecting ownership upon sale is that the price does not
change  if  the  two  parties  opted  for  continuity  of  ownership,  and  this
conforms to the Hanafi School, as opposed to Hanbalis.
If the option is rested with one party, then the position of this standard
is  based  on  a  variety  of  perspectives.  [see  applications  in  the  Shariah
Standard No. (8) on Murabahah]
Option to Revoke Due to Non-Payment
  The basis for permissibility is Qiyas (analogical deduction) to the coo-
The basis for permissibility is Qiyas (analogical deduction) to the coo-
ling-off option and reports dating back to the time of the companions.
It was taken up by Hanafis, Malikis and Hanbalis. The wisdom behind
its permissibility is the need for the buyer to reconsider/re-evaluate his
knowledge about prices and for the seller to ensure that the proper price
is quoted in order to avoid procrastination by the buyer.
The  basis  for  impermissibility  in  contracts  in  which  taking  possession
  The  basis  for  impermissibility  in  contracts  in  which  taking  possession
(Qabd) is a stipulation such as Sarf and Salam- is that it is inconsistent
with the stipulations of their validity.
The basis for abating of the option upon the death of its owner is that it
  The basis for abating of the option upon the death of its owner is that it
constitutes a readiness and willingness to act, and therefore is not transfe-
rable to heirs.
Either-Or Option
  The basis for permissibility of the either-or option is Qiyas (analogical
The basis for permissibility of the either-or option is Qiyas (analogical
deduction)  to  the  cooling-off  option;  since  it  conforms  to  Shariah  in-
junctions- i.e., the cooling-off option- so it was permissible based on it,
and due to the need of the buyer to employ it in case of hesitancy as to
selection  of  the  most  needful  from  amongst  a  number  of  objects.  The
majority of Fuqaha adopted it though with different views on definition
and scope.

Shariah Standard No. (53): Arboun (Earnest Money)
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This  Standard  covers  the  definition  of  Arboun  (Earnest  Money),  the
rules applicable to it and its applications in the activities of institutions
in commutative financial transactions that do not require spot delivery
of  countervalues.  It  does  not  cover  payments  made  prior  to  contract
such as refundable security deposits, commissions or advance payments
made subsequent to contracts that are not subject to options.
2. Definition of Arboun (Earnest Money)
2/1  Earnest  money  is  paid  by  the  buyer  to  the  seller(2)(2)  at  the  time  of
  at  the  time  of
2/1  Earnest  money  is  paid  by  the  buyer  to  the  seller
contract  on  the  basis  that  the  buyer  has  the  option  to  revoke  the
contract during an agreed period of time. If he confirms the contract,
the earnest money is credited towards the price. If he does not confirm
the contract or fails to pay the remaining price during the stipulated
time, the seller is entitled to forfeit Arboun (Earnest Money).
2/2  An agreement to execute a contract in the future (an agreement to sell)
is a promise and not a contract. If money is paid with the promise, it is
not considered to be earnest money (Arboun).
2/3  Arboun (Earnest Money) can be paid in cash, in kind and with a usu-
fruct.
3. Permissibility of Earnest Money
3/1  It  is  permissible  to  pay  Arboun  (Earnest  Money)  in  commutative
contracts that do not require spot payment of one or both counter-
values whether the sale item is identified or is sold by description
(2)(2) What applies to the buyer also applies to the lessee and the purchaser in an Istisnaa
 What applies to the buyer also applies to the lessee and the purchaser in an Istisnaa
contract, and what applies to the seller also applies to the lessor and the seller in an
istisnaa contract, etc.

for future delivery (
), such as sales,
Ijarah Mawsufah Fi al-Dhimmah), such as sales,
for future delivery (Ijarah Mawsufah Fi al-Dhimmah
Istisnaa contracts, leases of identified assets and of assets leased by
description for a future date.
3/2  Payment  of  Arboun  (Earnest  Money)  is  not  permissible  in  Salam
and currency exchange contracts.
4. Option Period Arising from Arboun (Earnest Money) Payment
  The option period arising from the payment of Arboun (Earnest Money)
must be specified either by express stipulation of the parties, or by custom
if there is an existing custom that specifies the option period.
5. Lapsing of the Option Arising from Arboun (Earnest Money) Payment
5/1  The  buyer  loses  his  right  to  revoke  the  contract  if  he  informs  the
seller that he has confirmed the contract or disposes the sold item
in a manner that indicates confirmation. The contract may stipulate
conduct that indicates lapsing of the option and confirmation of the
contract in order to avoid dispute. [see Shariah Standard No. (52) on
Options to Reconsider]
5/2  If the option period expires without the buyer paying the remaining
price to the seller and without the seller having agreed an extension,
the contract is considered revoked and the buyer is not entitled to
recover the Arboun (Earnest Money).
6. Ownership and Liability for the Sold Item During the Option Period
  Prior to delivery, the seller is liable for any loss to the sale item. If it is
destroyed or damaged before delivery to the buyer or delivery is not pos-
sible, the contract is void and the earnest money must be returned to the
buyer. After delivery, the buyer is liable for the sale item. If it is destroyed
or damaged after delivery to the buyer, the buyers option is canceled and
he is required to pay the balance (unpaid part of the price) to the seller.
7. Delivery of the Sale Item During the Option Period
  The buyer may take delivery of the sale item during the option period,
which does not on its own indicate confirmation of the contract unless
the buyers conduct indicates that he has accepted the sale item.
12371237
Shariah Standard No. (53): Arboun (Earnest Money)
8. Increase in the Sold Item During the Option Period
8/1  Increase  that  is  physically  connected  to  the  original  is  considered
part of the original.
8/2  In principle, any growth in (increase to, and/or yield of) the sale item
that  is  physically  separate  from  it,  which  occurs  during  the  option
period whether prior to delivery or after delivery is considered part
of the sale item. It is permissible for the party who is liable for the sale
item to stipulate that any increase that is physically separate should
belong  to  him,  even  if  ultimate  ownership  of  the  sale  item  is  not
vested in him.
9. Disposal of the Sale Item Under Arboun (Earnest Money) Arrangement
9/1  If the sold item is identified, the seller is not entitled to dispose of
it.  If  the  seller  does  dispose  of  it  by  sale  or  lease  or  otherwise,  his
actions are subject to the rules relating to uncommissioned (Fodooli)
disposals. If the buyer ratifies the sellers actions, he loses his option
and  is  liable  for  the  remainder  of  the  price  to  the  first  seller.  The
first sellers disposal becomes binding and the first buyer is entitled
to receive the sale price. If the first buyer does not ratify the sellers
actions, the second disposal is void. [see Shariah Standard No. (23)
on Agency and Acts of Uncommissioned Agent (Fodooli)]
9/2  If the sale is related to an identified item, the seller cannot deliver
a different item even with same specifications, except with the con-
sent  of  the  buyer,  in  which  case  what  the  buyer  has  paid  remains
Arboun (Earnest Money).
9/3  If the buyer stipulates that he will offer the sale item to his clients
during the option period and the seller accepts this, the buyers right
to revoke the contract remains valid during the option period, even
after offering the item to his clients. The conclusion of a sale to one
of his clients is deemed to be confirmation of the contract.
9/4  It is not permissible to negotiate/trade options arising from payments
of Arboun (Earnest Money). [see Shariah Standard No. (20) on Sale
of Commodities in Organized Markets]

Shariah Standard No. (53): Arboun (Earnest Money)
10. Stipulating Refund of Earnest Money in the Contract
It is permissible for the buyer to stipulate a condition in the contract
providing for a refund of earnest money in specific situations, such as
the buyers failure to obtain licenses from the relevant authorities.

Appendix (B)
The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  The basis for permissibility of Arboun (Earnest Money) is a narration
The basis for permissibility of Arboun (Earnest Money) is a narration
that Nafi Ibn Abdul-Harith purchased a building in Mecca to be used as
a prison from Safwan Ibn Umayyah, provided that if Umar (may Allah
be pleased with him) approves the sale, then the sale is considered to
be effected by him (Umar) and on his behalf (Umars), and if not, then
Safwan shall be paid 400 dinars.
  Also, there is a narration that Ibn Sirin said: A man said to a lessor of
ride camels: prepare your camels, so that if I did not leave with you on so
and so day, you get 100 dirhams. Then he did not leave with him. And
Shurayh said: He who voluntarily makes it incumbent upon himself to
do  something  (with  a  condition  and  without  coercion),  then  he  shall
have to honor the condition. Hence, Arboun is similar, where a buyer
pays part of the price and says: If I did not confirm the sale, the Arboun
is yours to keep. Payment of the Arboun either at time of contract or
later at the time of relinquishing it is valid.
  The  basis  for  impermissibly  of  Arboun  in

Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) is reported to have
said: O, Messenger of Allah, hold on that I may ask you a question: I sell

Majlis al-Aqd).).
Arboun  is  also  impermissible  in  Salam  contract,  because  in  Salam,
payment of the price (capital of Salam) shall be settled at the contracting
session. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
Whoever pays money in
session. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whoever pays money in
advance for dates (to be delivered later) should pay it for a known specified
weight and measure (of the dates).
. This implies that unless the price

is paid in full before the two parties leave the contracting session, the
transaction is not deemed to be Salaf (or Salam).
  The basis for determination of a specific term for Arboun is to avoid
The basis for determination of a specific term for Arboun is to avoid
Gharar that may result from an unknown term (Jahalah that involves
Arboun term).
  The basis for the seller being liable for the object of sale before delivery
The basis for the seller being liable for the object of sale before delivery
and for the buyer being liable for it after delivery is the Shariah maxim:
Ownership (title) shall be established upon the conclusion of the contract,
while liability is contingent upon delivery (Qabd).

Shariah Standard No. (54): Revocation of Contracts by Exercise of a Cooling-Off Option
Statement of the Standard
1. Scope of the Standard
  This Standard covers the stipulation of revocation of valid and binding
contracts and the causes and consequences of and impediments to such
revocation. It does not cover the expiry of contracts at the end of their
contractual terms or nullification owing to the absence of a condition
required by the Shariah.
2. Definition of Cooling-Off Options to Revoke
  Revocation by exercise of a cooling-off option refers to the termination
of a valid and binding contract by virtue of a stipulation in the contract
giving one of the parties the option to revoke the contract.
3. Form of Cooling-Off Options to Revoke
  A cooling-off option to revoke can be stipulated in the contract in any
form that indicates it, and it is not required to use any specific word with
the meaning of revocation.
4. Permissibility of Cooling-Off Options to Revoke
4/1 It is permissible for both parties to stipulate an option for one or both
of them to revoke the contract in specific situations agreed in the
of  them to revoke  the  contract  in specific situations agreed in  the
contract, without violating Shariah rules.
4/2 Revocation by exercise of a cooling-off option is valid if its causes
exist, its conditions are satisfied and there are no impediments. It is
invalid if its causes do not exist, any of its conditions is not satisfied,
if there is an impediment or it is contrary to Shariah.
5. Causes Triggering Revocation Rights
  The cause that triggers the cooling-off option is the existence of one of
the situations stipulated in the contract, the occurrence of which gives
one or both parties a conditional right to revoke.
12501250
Shariah Standard No. (54): Revocation of Contracts by Exercise of a Cooling-Off Option
6. Conditions of Valid Revocation
  The following conditions must be fulfilled for revocation to be valid:
6/1  Existence of the cause triggering the option to revoke at the time of
the revocation.
6/2  Absence of any impediments.
6/3  Notification of the revocation given by the owner of the cooling-off
option to the other party according to the requirements of custom.
6/4  Exercise  of  the  cooling-off  option  to  revoke  by  the  owner  of  the
option.
7. Impediments to Revocation
  Revocation cannot take place in the following situations:
7/1  Destruction of the sale item caused by a natural disaster after delivery.
7/2  Destruction of the sale item caused by the buyer whether before or
after delivery.
7/3  Conduct that transfers ownership and creates rights for third parties,
such as selling or gifting the sale item resulting in ownership passing
to a third party.
7/4  Expiry  of  the  period  specified  in  the  contract  for  exercise  of  the
cooling-off option.
8. Consequences of Revocation
  Revocation  nullifies  the  contract  at  the  moment  of  revocation.  Any
growth in the sale item that is physically attached to it is considered part
of it. Any growth in the sale item that is physically separate from it and
occurs between the time of contract and revocation and before the buyer
takes delivery belongs to the seller. If it occurs after deliver, it belongs to
the buyer.
9. Waiver of Revocation Rights
If the owner of a cooling-off option chooses not to exercise his right to
revoke and there is no specific recurring harm attributable to the cause
12511251
Shariah Standard No. (54): Revocation of Contracts by Exercise of a Cooling-Off Option
triggering the option, the buyer is deemed to have permanently waived
the option. If the harm attributable to the cause triggering the option is
recurring or continuous, the option is not waived. For example, if a leased
asset breaks down and the buyer chooses not to revoke the contract and
repairs the asset and then the asset breaks down again, the buyer is still
entitled to exercise his option to revoke.
10. Payment for Waiver of Revocation Rights
10/1  It is not permissible to stipulate payment for waiver of revocation
rights in a sale contract. In contracts that run for specified terms,
such  as  leases  (Ijarah),  Istisnaa,  debt  transfer  (
Hawalat  al-Dayn), ),
such  as  leases  (Ijarah),  Istisnaa,  debt  transfer  (Hawalat  al-Dayn
share cropping (Muzaraah), tree planting partnership (Mugharasah)
and  agency  (Wakalah),  it  is  permissible  for  one  of  the  parties  to
waive their rights to the remaining period of the contract in return
for a consideration agreed at the time of waiver.
10/2  Unforeseen circumstances resulting in non-exercise of a right to
revoke are excluded from the above rule.
11. Application of Cooling-Off Options to Revoke
11/1  Cooling-off options to revoke may be stipulated in credit facility
agreements to be triggered by events of default relating to solven-
cy, potential insolvency before it occurs or breach of a restrictive
covenant in the contract.
11/2  If the lessor stipulates in a lease contract that he is entitled to add
a supplementary rental amount at the beginning of each lease peri-
od to cover the costs of maintenance, insurance and taxes levied on
owners, and the lessee refuses to accept that, the lessor is entitled
to revoke the contract. If the lessee has given a prior promise to
purchase the leased asset, the lessor can exercise his rights under
the  promise  and  demand  performance  from  the  lessee  provided
that the supplementary rent for that lease period is not added to
the purchase price.
11/3  A creditor is entitled to stipulate the right, after notifying the debtor,
to accelerate all installments and the right to revoke the contract or
12521252
Shariah Standard No. (54): Revocation of Contracts by Exercise of a Cooling-Off Option
one of them in the event that the debtor fails to pay two or more
instalments despite being solvent.
11/4  If the seller stipulates that the buyer provides security or surety or
any other form of guarantee and the buyer fails to provide it, the
seller is entitled to revoke the contract.
11/5  For other situations of revocation that apply in options to reconsider,
options to revoke for incomplete performance and options to revoke
for breach of trust, see the relevant Shariah Standards.

The Shariah Basis for the Standard
  Stipulation  of  cooling-off  options  apply  only  to  binding  contracts  be-
Stipulation  of  cooling-off  options  apply  only  to  binding  contracts  be-
cause nonbinding contracts are by their nature revocable by one or both
parties.
  The validity of revocation by any form of language, that indicates it, is
The validity of revocation by any form of language, that indicates it, is
based on the general Shariah maxim: Contracts are interpreted accor-
ding to intent and inherent meaning of the parties and not by the words
or forms used (Maxims of Al-Majallah Al-Adliyyah) and the statement
of some jurists that the use of the technical word Revocation is desi-
gnated by jurists and what is important is its meaning.(2)(2)
gnated by jurists and what is important is its meaning.
  The  existence  of  the  cause  triggering  the  option  to  revoke  is  required
The  existence  of  the  cause  triggering  the  option  to  revoke  is  required
because revocation is contrary to the norm and rule that contracts are
generally binding and that in principle consequences must flow necessarily
from their causes, and that the cause must exist at the time of revocation.(3)(3)
from their causes, and that the cause must exist at the time of revocation.
The requirement that the other party be notified of revocation is based on
  The requirement that the other party be notified of revocation is based on
the opinion of Abu Hanifah and Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan, contrary to the
opinion of the majority of jurists, because notification averts harm from
the other party who, unaware of the revocation, may conduct themselves
to their detriment.
  The  four  impediments  to  the  exercise  of  cooling-off  options  are  based
The  four  impediments  to  the  exercise  of  cooling-off  options  are  based
variously on the following rationale: (I) Revocation would contradict the
basic elements of the contract which have been validly established; or (II)
revocation would contradict consent implied by conduct (implied terms
have the same legal effect as express ones); or (III) revocation is impossible
because the term of the contract has expired; or (IV) the subject matter of
the option to revoke is deemed by law to have ceased to exist.

  The basis for the ruling on the effect of revocation and that revocation
The basis for the ruling on the effect of revocation and that revocation
nullifies  the  contract  immediately,  is  the  prevailing  viewpoint  of  the
Shafii  and  Hanbali  schools.  Revocation  invalidates  ownership  in  sale
contracts. This ruling holds true for the asset sold (subject-matter of the
contract),  whereas  increments  in  the  asset  sold  (separate  growth)  from
time of contracting until revocation and before delivery to buyer, belong
to the seller who becomes the owner at or just prior to time of revocation.(4)(4)
to the seller who becomes the owner at or just prior to time of revocation.
When the buyer takes possession of the asset sold, any separate growth
belongs to him.
  The basis for the rulings stated in item 9 regarding waiver of revocation
The basis for the rulings stated in item 9 regarding waiver of revocation
right is the viewpoint which Al-Zarkashi has indicated in his book titled
Al-Manthur Fi Al-Qawaid.(5)(5)
Al-Manthur Fi Al-Qawaid
  The basis for impermissibility of stipulating compensation in the contract
The basis for impermissibility of stipulating compensation in the contract
as a condition for waiver of revocation right, is based on analogy to Iqa-
lah, which is considered as one form of contract revocation and has to be
performed without any increase or decrease in considerations. Similarly,
Shariah prohibits waiver of some rights (such as pre-emption and demar-
cation rights) against compensation.
  The basis for permissibility of stipulating, in the contract, compensation
The basis for permissibility of stipulating, in the contract, compensation
for waiver of the remaining periods of revocation right, in case of conti-
nuous contracts such as leasing, is the fact that the party who waives his
right owns a benefit that makes him entitled to remuneration.
  The basis for applications of conditional revocation is the rulings indicated
The basis for applications of conditional revocation is the rulings indicated
in the Shariah standard that relates to each application, because rulings on
these applications are derived from these preceding standards.

Islamic Financial Services in SABB
Banks have become very important for all people and businesses all over
the world. They are the backbone of any financial or economic system at both
the local and international levels. Due to their importance, banks are highly
regulated by most countries. This is because the countrys economy depends
totally  on  the  activities  of  its  banks.  The  stronger  and  more  effective  the
banks are, the more likely it is that the economic and financial systems may
be more stable and effective. All this explains why the countries normally
pay much attention to monitoring and regulating systems for their banks
and financial institutions as a means to maintain and increase the efficiency
of their banking and financial operations.
The increasing number of economic and financial activities and trans-
actions in the world in general and in the Islamic community in particular
highlights the need for more Islamic banking services. This is why the Islamic
banks, in a highly competing market, do their best to provide their custom-
ers with high-quality Islamic banking services that help them manage their
financial transactions in a Shariah-compliant way.
The Saudi British Bank (SABB) is one of the banks that offer such
Islamic  banking  services.  In  2001,  the  Bank  opened  a  new  section,
Amanah,  to  provide  services  and  products  compatible  with  Shariah
standards under the supervision of an independent Shariah Committee.
In 2012, the name of this section has been changed to Islamic Financial
Services.
